  overview: |
    The following compendium provides a comprehensive overview of the Iron Pact, officially styled as the Confederacy of the Hemlig, a maritime power of significant consequence situated among the southern islands of the Hemlig Reach. Founded formally in the year 1471 CD through the codification of the namesake Pact, this sovereign entity governs a rugged archipelago defined by its isolation and its industry. It possesses no shared land borders with the other great powers of the world, yet it maintains a robust presence upon the waves through established sea links with the realms of Ostravia and Novograd, the various southern Elysian duchies, the distant Kiyo Shogunate, and the Kingdom of Alba. The southern extent of the state’s effective dominion is marked by the Daryl Sound, a frigid boundary beyond which the climate becomes too severe for permanent habitation or administration, save for the occasional and perilous exploratory mission into the ice.

    The antiquity of the Reach is profound, with seafaring tribes from the regions of modern Ostravia and the Duchy of Preveza first making landfall some fifty thousand years ago. Despite this ancient lineage, earnest colonization did not commence until forty millennia in the past. For much of its early history, the population remained sparse, estimated at a mere sixty thousand souls until the eventual rise of settled agriculture, the exploitation of mineral wealth, and the opening of sea lanes to Ikezaki. The rocky and unforgiving terrain of the islands made the development of farming a difficult endeavor, yet inland communities were successfully established six thousand years ago, facilitating a migration away from the ancestral fishing villages of the coast. This era also yields the first archaeological evidence of the Drowned God, a deity whose worship is theorized to predate even these findings. A mysterious network of submerged tunnels beneath the White Cliffs of Harwick, constructed five millennia ago when sea levels were lower, remains a subject of great interest to modern scholars hoping to illuminate the region's prehistoric darkness.

    In the middle centuries, specifically between 600 and 1000 CD, the Reach saw the ascendancy of the Salt Kingdoms based in Harwick, Stahlkollen, Nebelford, and Donnersberg, the latter of which now hosts the capital city of Salzstein. These kingdoms launched vast fleets of raiders and traders who reshaped the world’s map. They founded the Kingdom of Nordgardr in Ostravia and catalyzed the militarization of the Elysian church into the Pantokratene Order following the sacking of their monasteries. While their efforts to settle Elysia met with less success, the resulting economic exhaustion contributed significantly to the loss of Elysian territories in Novograd. These intrepid mariners further established states in the Shattered Isles and Ikezaki. 
    
    The greatest impact of these men was on the isle of Alba. Prior to the unification of the kingdom by Aethelfred the Great in 1021 CD, Alba was divided into seven warring kingdoms. The rise of the Salt Kingdoms led to three centuries of intermittent conflict, onvasion and migration. Though their ambitions were checked by the frozen south, as evidenced by the failed expeditions of Ralf von Skolter in 793 CD and Jakub von Fruck in 921 CD.

    The political character of the isles shifted again in 1059 CD following Aethelfred's unification in 1021 CD. And changed further with the arrival of Richard "Redsail" Kyningesmarch and an army raised from the erstwhile kingdom of Fyrdlaken, which by this time had knelt to the crown in Harndon. Though he conquered the Reach in the name of the Alban crown, the great distance from the capital at Harndon ensured that the Kyningesmarch ruled as de facto sovereigns for a century. This arrangement persisted until the Revolt of the Tenth Tide, an uprising that compelled the ruling house to renounce its fealty to Alba and rechristen itself as the House of Rikesmark. This transition culminated in the 1471 declaration of the Confederacy.

    In the present day, the Iron Pact distinguishes itself as a formidable industrial and military power. It maintains one of the world's premier naval forces and a conscripted land army supported by a system of universal service. The state’s economy is buoyed by a flourishing clothing industry and advanced ironworks, both driven by a rapid pace of mechanization. Utilizing its vast reserves of coal and iron, the Pact has outfitted its military with a disproportionately heavy amount of artillery. The populace is remarkably literate, with rates exceeding ninety percent, and the state has managed to sustain its growing numbers by converting nearly all forests into arable land, with the exception of those oak groves strictly reserved for naval timber. While food imports now supplement the domestic yield, the government actively seeks new methods to address the pressure of its burgeoning population. 
    
    This need for expansion has led to the controversial colonization of outlying islands and the construction of naval bases, most notably in the Frondic Straits. Such actions have drawn sharp protests from the Kiyo Shogunate, which views the proximity of these outposts to its lands in Ikezaki with increasing suspicion. Moreover the recent annexation of The Tooth and The Sisters in the Shattered Isles has reignited tensions between the Pact and Alba, as interests collide in the region. Rhetoric from the maritime neighbours has often been belligerent, although direct conflict has been averted as of now. 
  etymology: |
    The present governance of the Hemlig Reach finds its legal and philosophical origin in the events of the fifteenth century, specifically the year 1471 CD. At this juncture, the political equilibrium of the islands underwent a definitive transition from a nominal feudal dependency of the Alban Crown to a structured confederation of landed interests. This transformation was precipitated by a coalition of the foremost junkers, or landed nobility, who styled themselves the Lords Declarant. Seeking to codify their traditional rights and the collective security of the Reach, these lords presented a formal ultimatum to Earl Ulfrick Kyningesmarch at his ancestral seat of Konigfalla in Nebelford.

    The resulting instrument of governance, known formally as the Confederacy of the Hemlig and colloquially as the Iron Pact, represents a foundational contract between the executive authority and the principal houses of the realm. Among the prominent signatories were the houses of Skantenveld, Eldholt, Derfflinger, von Wrangel, von Riktof, and von Skolter. By acceding to the conditions set forth by the Lords Declarant, Earl Ulfrick effectively dissolved his ancient obligations to the court at Harndon. In a symbolic gesture of this new domestic alignment, he rechristened his lineage the House of Rikesmark, signaling a departure from Alban fealty in favor of a localized sovereignty.

    The document was ratified by each of the constituent houses and concluded with the solemn inscription, "Eisen und Blut." While these words served as the official motto of the newly formed polity, they also bestowed upon the union its enduring name: the Iron Pact.

    ### The Riksdag

    While the Confederacy is often termed a "Parliamentary Republic" by contemporary theorists, the moniker is rendered largely meaningless by the state’s singular internal architecture. The central apparatus of governance is the Riksdag, a legislative body of two hundred and ten seats. It bears little resemblance to the deliberative assemblies of Alba, functioning instead as a precisely calibrated scale for weighing the influence of the various factions that dominate the Reach.

    *   **The Military Estate (40 Seats)**: The composition of this block is determined by the high command of the armed forces. As is the custom of an island power, the Admiralty of the Fleet enjoys the lion’s share of this representation.
    *   **The Declarant’s Quarters (30 Seats)**: Reserved for the Junker class, this section represents the landed gentry whose ancestors forced the original compact. While the state has increasingly ennobled commoners of merit to maintain the numbers, the historic houses—Skantenveld, Rikesmark, von Wrangel, Derfflinger, and von Skolter—remain the true arbiters of this quarter.
    *   **The Popular Districts (140 Seats)**: The overwhelming majority is determined by district-level suffrage. The electorate is comprised of any citizen, regardless of sex, whose wealth exceeds five times the annual stipend of an infantryman—a census that ensures the "voice of the people" is, in truth, the voice of the prosperous.

    Every ten years, this body elects from among its own number a Sealord to serve as the chief magistrate. The incumbent, Danvedor Sturmmveld, now nears the conclusion of his decennial term. It must be noted that the Sealord’s authority is far from absolute; in the common course of affairs, he appears as little more than a weary mayor presiding over a fractious city. His prerogative is limited to the setting of the legislative agenda and the exercise of a veto. In practice, his power is entirely dependent upon his ability to cajole and convince the various quarters of the Riksdag to align with his vision.

    This legislative gridlock extends to the economy. The representatives of the Popular Districts maintain a fierce guard over low industrial taxes and the principles of free trade, rendering the state’s fiscal policy largely immune to executive interference. While a Sealord may attempt to embargo specific foreign powers or prohibited goods—provided he has the steel of the Military Estate behind him—the staggering prosperity born of the current status quo makes any radical departure from these policies politically untenable.

    ### The Krigsrad (Council of War)

    However, one must not mistake this procedural sloth for fundamental weakness. The Pact maintains a terrifying mechanism for survival known as the State of Peril. Upon a vote of the Riksdag, the Sealord may invoke this emergency status, whereby the civil law is suspended and the nation is governed absolutely by a council of the Sealord and the Krigsrad. In such times, all resources of the Reach are bent to the singular purpose of the state. Even the most liberal members of the Popular Districts are known to support such measures, for they understand that their silks and ironworks are ultimately guaranteed by the fire of the gunships.

    We shall now turn our attention to the institution known as the Krigsrad, or Council of War—a body the equal of which I have not discovered in any other civilized nation. While ostensibly formed to provide the Sealord with the counsel of his foremost admirals and generals, the centuries have seen its scope distend until it has acquired characteristics as curious as they are formidable. In the present day, the Krigsrad is composed of twenty permanent members supported by an immense retinue of aides and clerks, whose daily labor is the meticulous planning of hypothetical conflicts. This staff functions with a precision that borders on the obsessive; they calculate the arrival of supply vessels, the allocation of black powder, and the movements of battalions for wars that may never be fought.

    The jurisdiction of this council, however, extends far beyond the mere deployment of troops. It holds absolute authority over matters of conscription, naval architecture, and military law. Most curiously, the Krigsrad maintains a legislative supremacy over the Riksdag in all matters pertaining to the armed forces, governing these concerns by sovereign decree. Such decrees can only be overturned by a joint veto of the Sealord and a two-thirds majority of the Riksdag—a parliamentary feat rendered nearly impossible by the very composition of that assembly.

    Furthermore, the Krigsrad has seen fit to entrench itself in the nation’s industry; it possesses entire ironworks and shipyards, such as the storied Copper Dock at Salzstein, and maintains controlling stakes in over half the steel foundries of Nebelford. Its financial appetite is equally absolute: the Council issues a demand for coin, which the Sealord is legally bound to fulfill save for the most stringent of exceptions. In a gesture of transparency that barely masks this power, the Council publishes monthly expense reports, ostensibly inviting the Riksdag to investigate its dealings, though the shroud of "military secrecy" frequently renders such oversight a hollow exercise.

    The internal character of this martial aristocracy is inextricably linked to the old houses of the Reach. The officer corps is overwhelmingly dominated by the Junkers, who, despite constituting a mere five percent of the general population, command sixty percent of the commissions. Even those commoners who rise through the ranks by dint of their education and merit find themselves so thoroughly steeped in the social circles of the nobility that they inevitably marry into the ancient families, adopting their prejudices and interests. Thus, the Krigsrad remains the primary bastion of the old houses.

  demographics: |
    The demographic character of the Iron Pact is distinguished by a precocious tilt toward the urban centers, a phenomenon that sets it apart from the more agrarian rhythms of the neighboring powers. While the ancestral fishing hamlets and rocky farmsteads endure, nearly half of the total population—exceeding two million souls—now resides within the burgeoning cities. Preeminent among these is the capital, Salzstein, situated upon the Isle of Donnersberg. Once a modest center for the salt trade, it has been transformed by the looms of the textile industry into a sprawling metropolis of four hundred thousand inhabitants. Other centers of significant activity include Sudgau and Rosencratz upon Nebelford, the heights of Harwickberg, and the industrial forge of Gartencott on Stahlkollen.

    This rapid urbanization has fundamentally eroded the traditional peasantry. In their stead has risen a new urban working class, composed of the sons of farmers and fishermen who have sought the mobility offered by the state’s industrial expansion. Though the statutes of serfdom remain active in the legal theory of the Junkers, they are increasingly a dead letter; the state grants broad exemptions to the foundries and mills, allowing a steady stream of rural labor to escape the soil for the forge.

    ### Social Strata

    Consequently, the social fabric of the Pact has bifurcated into several distinct and novel strata:

    *   **The Landed Junkers**: The traditional nobility whose priveleges have been stripped from them by the state. Every memeber bar the heir in a Junker family is required to serve in the military.
    *   **The Urban Laborers**: A massive class of former peasants who now operate the coal mines, ironworks, and textile mills.
    *   **The Professionals**: A class birthed by state-mandated education, consisting of engineers, architects, and technical officers who manage the machinery of both industry and war.
    *   **The Venturers**: A new aristocracy of wealth, distinct from the old merchant houses, who have amassed vast fortunes through the speculative investment of capital into iron, coal, and mechanized production.

    Regarding the spiritual life of the islands, the observer encounters a most singular uniformity. The primary figure of veneration is the Drowned God, whose cult is so universally accepted that the state has felt no necessity to codify an official religion. The theology of this faith is starkly distinct from the moral philosophies of the Continent. To the priests of the Reach, the Drowned God is an entity of implacable and temperamental nature, mirroring the very sea from which He takes His name. His dictates are few but absolute: He is the arbiter of all life, and at the conclusion of one's earthly tenure, the soul must be rendered back to Him through the return of the physical corpse to the deep waters. Having observed these rites firsthand, the author finds them sufficiently grim as to decline further commentary upon the matter.
