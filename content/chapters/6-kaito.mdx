Kaito bowed deeply, the movement a slow agony. His thighs burned with a dull, throbbing heat, and the iron buckle of his belt bit into his belly with every breath. Above, the lamps swayed in a sudden draft, their light guttering and hazy through the thick pall of powder smoke that clung to the back of the throat like a wet wool shroud.

"Speak, Kaito Sato," came the command from Lord Kashiro.

It was a languid sound, smooth as polished jade and entirely bored. Kaito felt a flash of bitter resentment.

For a fleeting moment, Kaito’s knees wobbled, threatening to spill him onto the floorboards. He reached out, steadying himself against the edge of the great map table before drawing his frame upright once more. The chamber was a hive of frantic activity, even as the setting sun brought a temporary, shivering truce to the slaughter outside. but as Kaito stood before the high chair, the chatter died away into a suffocating silence.

“My Lord,” Kaito began, thin and brittle in the vastness of the hall. He forced the words louder, projecting them until they reached the darkened corners where the shadows pooled. “I bring word from Lord Tokugawa, whose banners march even now toward Ido to thwart the machinations of the Iron Pact. I bring news, too, from the ramparts of Ido itself, where our brothers do courageous battle against the sea-devils.”

It was a small mercy that the Daimyo was not present; the old man’s doddering presence would have snapped what little remained of Kaito’s resolve.

Kashiro did not speak at first. He reached for a delicate glass of frosted crystal that sat upon the table beside him. The faint rouge upon the General’s cheeks spoke of a fine, heady sake, and he sipped it with the practiced grace of a man taking a turn through the plum gardens of Kiyomura.

“That is gladdening to the ear,” Kashiro said, his tone as cool as a winter stream. “I am certain that tidings of such success will bolster the spirits of every man in this council of war. Much as the display of our own might here has already done.”

The thunder of the guns still rang in his ears, a relentless, rhythmic pounding that sundown had stilled but could not silence. In all his years, he had never seen such a gathering of iron. He had never seen so many Shogunate guns crammed onto so narrow a frontage, nor had he believed an enemy fleet could vomit forth fire in such staggering, impossible quantities.

He blinked, and for a heartbeat, the map before him vanished. In its place, he saw the *Isami* again, the pride of the waves, her stout hull shattered into a thousand jagged splinters in the first nine minutes of the firestorm, her men screaming as the sea turned into a boiling cauldron of blood and oil.*clink, clink, clink*—like the sound of a blacksmith’s hammer on a cold anvil.

“My Lord, the ravens bring word of a black day. The enemy has taken the fortress of Miyumi by most treacherous means. Fu...”

“What did you say?” Kashiro did not scream; a great lord has no need of screaming. He rose half-upright, his movement slow and predatory. His manner remained calm, yet it carried a cold fury that seemed to suck the very warmth from the braziers, making the lamps gutter as if a ghost had passed through the hall.

“Miyumi has fallen, My Lord. The enemy’s treachery was deeper than the sea.”

“I see.” Kashiro pulled a kerchief of fine, pale lace from his sleeve and coughed into it—,  dry, hacking sound. He stared at the spot of dampness on the silk for a heartbeat before tucking it away. “I certainly hope the remainder of your tidings is of a more congenial nature.”

Kaito grimaced. The room was filled with the high lords and officers of the Shogunate, draped in the finery of a thousand years of tradition, silks of cherry-blossom pink, deep crimson, sky blue, and forest green. One great lord tugged absently at the golden cord of his sash; another coughed into his sleeve and turned his gaze to the rafters.

“The road,” Kaito began, his voice gaining a desperate speed, “the great artery that sated Ido’s appetite for powder, rice, and shot... it has been turned into a charnel house. Our scouts report the way is barred by enemy dragoons, their steel red with the blood of our carters.”

He did not pause for breath, fearing that if he stilled his tongue, he would never find the courage to start again. “The last word from Colonel Shinzo arrived on a lathered horse. The Iron Pact has put their boots upon the shingle near Ido in great numbers. Shinzo begs for immediate aid to reassert control over the supply lines, and he cries out for powder and shot to feed his hungry guns.”

Kaito stood breathless, his heart hammering against his ribs like a trapped bird, the words falling over one another in his haste.

“I had cautioned the Daimyo against gifting Watanabe such responsibility,” Kashiro said, shaking his head with a slow, practiced disappointment. He took another long sip of his sake. . “A most grave error, to trust a man of such common clay with the defense of the realm.”

“Regardless, the most brave and honorable Lord Tokugawa is already on the march. He will bring the relief that Ido requires, and he will remind these sea-wolves that the Shogunate does not break so easily.”

Kaito felt his teeth gnash together, the sound of bone on bone lost in the shifting murmurs of the hall.

“The vanguard of Lord Tokugawa’s force was assaulted by what he described as evil men who fought like demons,” Kaito said.. “They were beset at the midnight hour, scarcely an hour ago. We have gleaned no information as to the size of the host responsible for the attack..”

A loud, sharp clang rang through the room, cutting the air like a blade.

Kashiro’s glass tumbled from his fingers, rolling across the table before hitting the floor. The fine sake spilled out, soaking into the elegant carpet and staining the white lilies sewn there a deep, impossible red. For a heartbeat, the General’s hand shook, before he forced a smile back onto his face.

“I have no doubt that Tokugawa will vanquish these beggars,” he said quickly.

Hinita Kuribayashi, master of the inland farmlands, finally found his tongue. He leaned forward, his hand trembling against the dark lacquer of the table. “That does imply a force has slipped into our rear,” he whispered, his eyes wide. “A force so deluded, or so strong, that they think to challenge Tokugawa himself.”

Kaito did not wait for the bickering to bloom. He took his leave as the first sharp accusations began to fly like arrows across the map. Outside, it was a beautiful night; the moon hung in the sky in all her pale glory, indifferent to the blood on the grass.

*Beggars,* he thought, the word bitter as gall. The men he had seen in the dispatches did not look like beggars. They looked like the end of an age.

He stepped around a house that had collapsed under the weight of the day's shelling, its heavy wooden beams tossed about like a child’s matchsticks. He made his way toward the flickering light of his office, the only thing still burning in a street of shadows. The road was deserted, save for the odd, flickering fires burning in the hills, a landscape churned and broken where the Shogunate struggled to hold back the tide.

When Kaito pushed the door open, the air within was thick with the scent of ink and old paper,  almost clean compared to the sulfurous rot that choked the streets outside. He moved with a feverish haste to his cabinet, a stout thing of carved oak adorned with verses from the poems of Miyazaki, though he had no heart for poetry this night.

His fingers found the pistol first. It gleamed in the low light, the steel slick with the diligent oiling he gave it every seventh day. He tucked it into his belt, the weight of it a cold comfort against his hip. With a snarl of disdain, he unbuckled the ceremonial sash of his office, a useless length of silk and vanity, and cast it onto the floorboards. In its place, he cinched a heavy belt of boiled leather tight around his waist.

He hung his sabre there, the scabbard wrapped in a fabric as soft as velvet, yet holding a blade that knew only hunger. The bayonet went into its pouch with a sharp *clack*, and he slung the long musket over his shoulder, the strap biting into his bruised collarbone.

He eased around the side of the office toward the stables. The yard was a place of ghosts and silence, save for the distant, low muttering of the guns that never truly slept. The stableboys were huddled in the straw, mercifully ignorant of the storm Kaito intended to ride into.

No need to wake them.

He eased the stable gate open, and the iron hinges let out a groan that sounded as loud as a trumpet blast in the stillness. Kaito froze, his heart hammering against his ribs, waiting for a shout from the watch.. None came. He made his way to Hana’s stall, and the mare snorted low when she scented him, her hooves giving quick, impatient stomps against the dirt.

There were but a few hours until the grey dawn would break.

He could make Ido by daybreak if the roads didn't swallow him whole. A friend was in peril, and it would be an affront to God himself were he to forget that. If Shinzo was in danger, he ought to share it too.

Led the mare out into the night air. Hana snorted and sneezed, her nostrils flared as she tasted the acrid powder on the wind. She liked it no better than he did.

Kaito vaulted into the saddle, the leather creaking beneath him. He patted himself down once,sabre, powder horn, musket, pistol, shot. For a heartbeat, he sat perfectly still, listening to the rasp of the horse’s breath and the ragged echo of his own. He cracked his knuckles, gripped the reins until his gloves strained, and turned Hana’s head toward the north.

The first stop was a grove of trees huddled around a tiny spring. The moonlight lay flat across the pond, a pale sheet trembling with every ripple of the wind. The stars burned in the water too, sharp and still, until Kaito’s shadow bent them out of shape. He uncorked the flask at his belt and tipped it toward his mouth. Nothing. Not even the taste of metal remained.

His throat was parched, the skin of it feeling like old parchment. The water looked black and shallow, a mirror with no depth. He crouched beside the bank, his fingers fishing through his coat for his lighter. His thumb ran over the cold brass, seeking the familiar friction, but he did not strike the flame. There were twigs scattered near the bank, dry enough for a small blaze, but he would not invite the eyes of the night. Not here. Not now.

He wiped the sweat from his brow, though the air was cool.

He dared not light a fire.

He dared not drink this water.

Yet, he dipped his flask under the surface and watched the bubbles come rushing up like dying gasps. His throat ached for a swallow, but the pond stank of rot. A film of green algae broke apart where he dipped the flask, clinging to the metal like a sickly shroud.

It was a silent night, the most silent he had known in three days of fire. It was a bright night, the moon a pale goddess reigning over a world of ash. Far to the north, the horizon burned a dull, bruised red. Ido? The smoke itself was a ghost in the dark, visible only by the emptiness it opened in the skies. No stars lived in the north now, and even the moon’s glory was diminished by the shroud that hung there. Even miles away, Kaito felt the ash strike his nostrils, dry, papery and tasting faintly of bone.

Hana struck the earth with a sudden, sharp hoof, mud splattered up his leg, warm and heavy, before sliding back into the muck. Her ears were pinned flat against her skull, her head low, her eyes fixed on the dark beyond the treeline. The tendons along her neck stood out like taut ropes.

*Time to leave.*

He put a boot in the stirrup and pulled himself up. The saddle creaked once, a lonely sound in the grove.

A soft nudge from his heel, and she started. The path through the pines took shape only in fragments, wet leaves, exposed roots, the pale line of the sea’s reflection shimmering somewhere through the trunks like a blade. The ground gave a low sigh under the mare's weight.

The night was late, and through the soft, rhythmic sway of the ride, sleep overtook him before he could fight it. He drifted in that grey space between the saddle and the dream, while the horse carried him deeper into the mouth of the north.

It was a summer day. The wind came in from the harbors of Kiyomura, heavy with salt and the cries of gulls. His father rowed them out, the oars dipping in rhythm, carving smooth arcs through the green-blue water. The fishing net lay coiled beside him, still damp, smelling of brine and old rope. The dinghy rocked gently beneath their feet-a blue one, worn at the edges, but proud all the same.

His father had let him come this time. He leaned over the gunwale, eyes wide at the rippling colors below-green melting to sapphire, gold where the light struck. Shadows moved in it. Tuna, he thought. Big ones. He’d catch one. He’d show them. All the kids at the school. None of them had ever caught something so large. He would show them all. He sat back, fists clenched around the edge of the bench, watching his father’s arms flex with each pull.

Mighty arms. Strong arms.

Then no arms.

No boat.

Only the letter.

It lay where his father had sat, its edges curling, smoke blooming upward until it filled the sky. The sea turned to ash beneath it, and the smoke became the world.

“Papa-” The word tore through him. His throat caught fire, and he jolted upright.

The night rushed back. The smell of burning was gone, replaced by sweat and the damp rot of the forest. His chest heaved. Each breath rasped, raw against a dry throat. He coughed, tried to swallow, and the pain lanced down like a knife.

“No, no…” His voice cracked, barely more than a thread of sound. It vanished as soon as it left his lips.

The forest pressed close, a crowd of silent, weeping giants leaning in to catch his final breath. The air was thick enough to chew, heavy with a dampness that felt like the sweat of the dead. Even the insects had fled this place, leaving a silence so absolute it made his ears ring. Only the faint, agonizing creak of wood shifted in the dark, the groan of a world being crushed underfoot.

He stayed frozen, his breath a shallow, jagged thing. The blood thudded in his temples with a rhythmic violence, each beat sounding like a heavy boot striking the earth.

By instinct, his hand found the timepiece. The chain was cool and slick with his own sweat. He flicked it open with his thumb, and the hinge let out a tiny, high-pitched squeak that felt as loud as a scream in the stillness. He flinched, his heart leaping into his throat. There was no moon here, only the suffocating shroud of smoke dragging across the canopy, choking the last traces of the light of the gods. The dial caught a phantom flash of grey and then vanished back into the black.

He didn't move. He didn't even dare to let his lungs expand.

A firefly drifted past him, its light a pale, sickly green. It moved lazily at first, then darted with a sudden, panicked speed as if it had sensed the predator in the dark. It veered left, then right,  before it vanished into the maw of the trees.

Then came the sound.

A branch cracked. Then another, sharper, close, the sound of a heavy weight shifting in the muck.

Kaito’s back stiffened like a spear. His breath caught, shallow and hot. He didn't wait to see the face of the demon. He kicked Hana hard in her flanks and yanked the reins with a desperate strength; the mare spun a half-circle, her hooves slipping and churning in the mud. He pulled again, harder, guiding her off the path and into the thicket.

There was a bokan ahead, four Nemori trees, grown in a perfect circle by the hands of some long-dead monk or the whim of a cruel god. The ring opened just enough for a horse to slip through, a needle's eye of safety in a world of blades. The branches scraped his shoulder like skeletal fingers as they entered, and the scent of wet bark and sticky resin rose up to choke him.

Inside the circle, the air changed. The world outside flattened to a muffled hum, as if he had stepped behind a heavy curtain. He could still feel the road, a malevolent presence just beyond the wood, but the trees pressed the noise away. The darkness here was a physical weight.

A cicada started up, a lonely herald of a summer that might never come. Its call was shrill and solitary, echoing against the thick trunks until the sound swelled, filling every gap in the bokan. It grew louder than the breaking branches, louder than the baying of distant hounds, louder even than the ghostly voices that had begun to creep at the edge of his hearing. It drowned out the pulse hammering behind his ears like a war drum.

Then came the light.

A thread at first, then a shimmer through the narrow cracks of the Nemori ring. A lamp. It was moving, swaying with a rhythmic, lurching gait. It paused, then lurched again, each swing painting the leaves in brief, sickening flashes of amber and jagged shadow.

“Bastards,” a voice spat from the road. A mumble, but the words were Kiyo, his own tongue, his own people.

Kaito froze, his hand white-knuckled upon the stock of his musket. *Miyamoto’s men,* he thought, and for a fleeting second, his heart lifted like a bird taking wing. But the hope was a traitor.

Next came the other sound—the rougher one. The beggar tongue of the Pact. It was a harsh, clipped, and brutal language, an ugly rhythm of iron and gravel that did not belong to this soil. The hope died in his throat, and the cold claw of terror returned to grip his chest until it pained him to draw breath.

The voices outside grew louder. The sound of boots sucking in the mud. The clink of metal on metal, canisters, sabres, spurs. One of them coughed, a dry, hacking sound that broke the night’s stillness like a gunshot.

Kaito’s jaw clenched until his teeth ached. A sudden, hot rage flashed through him, rage at the fear that held him pinned inside a ring of trees like a rat in a snare, and a deeper, darker rage at these interlopers. These beggars had stepped off their black ships not a week ago, and already they scoured the sacred woods as if they owned the very earth and the souls buried beneath it.
