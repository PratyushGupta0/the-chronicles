Alexis pulled up his cowl to shield himself from the rain, though the effort was well-nigh useless. It was a slow, persistent drizzle, the sort of clinging wet that possessed enough vigor to seep through the thickest wool and dampen a man’s spirit until it was as grey as the sky. The rain slid in greasy rivulets off the crooked roofs of Koronow, where half-built houses leaned into one another like drunkards for balance, and shops with fine, gilded names hid nothing but stinking brothels and gin dens behind their painted signs. Alexis weaved through the press of the city’s gutterfolk, watching his step with the care of a man walking a blade. The cobblestones were naught but a rumor here; the street had long ago dissolved into a brown slurry of mud and dung that steamed faintly in the chill.

He stuck to the edges of the thoroughfare, pressing his back against the damp stone. A cart came barreling down the lane, which was scarcely wide enough to accommodate the timber of the wagon. It was drawn by two frantic horses and governed by a scrawny child who seemed to hang onto the bench only by the grace of the High One. The beasts were racing ahead with a blind, panicked speed, their reins untouched by any human hand. Alexis flattened himself against the cold mortar of a wall, the rough stone scraping his cheek as the wheels tore past him, spraying a fan of filth that coated him from head to toe.

Once the wagon had vanished into the mist, he unpinned himself from the wall and offered a short, stiff nod to the washerwoman in her doorway. She greeted him with a smile that lacked for teeth, and he returned the expression as best he could before turning right past her shop. The brewery stood at the corner, a hulking mass of brick, and there he turned left along a winding street until the smell of hops and rain worsened into a thick, staggering stench.

The rain pattered down in a relentless cadence, drumming against the filth.

There were more people here, a surging tide of desperate souls, and bodies crashed into him over and over as men moved with a blind, uncaring haste. The moment he stepped inside the tavern, the air hit him like a physical blow, a thick, cloying mixture of woodsmoke, old sweat, and the sharp tang of cheap, bitter beer. Two men crashed into a table, splintering the wood, while another swung a bottle that burst like a clap of thunder against the far wall.

Maria’s shout rose out over the din, sharp and commanding as a sergeant's. “Cut it down, you bastards!”

He saw his wife making her way toward him, pushing and shoving her way through the press of stinking wool and unwashed flesh. She caught his eye, her face flushed with the heat of the room. “Deal with it, Lex!” she shrieked, and even through the roar of the crowd and the discordant scraping of the bad music, her words cut clean through the fog of the bar.

Alexis nodded and began to shoulder his way toward the center of the room. There he found Hector, whose massive body swayed with the weight of the alcohol he had consumed. The crowd had formed a ragged ring around the combatants, and the sound of clanging glasses filled the air like the ringing of a madman’s bells.

“Wagers! Place your wagers!” a thin, reedy voice shrieked above the roar, a sound like a knife scraping against glass. Alexis reached out and caught Vitten by the collar before the man’s next word could sour the air further. He hauled the smaller man toward him, spinning him around until they were nose to nose.

“No more damn wagers!” he screamed into Vitten’s face.

Vitten sulked, his lip curling in a classic display of petty grievance. “Alright, alright,” he muttered, vanishing back into the sweating, stinking throng like a rat into a sewer. Petr stood opposite Hector, both men panting with a dull, animal fury.

Alexis didn’t waste words. He led with his shoulder, shoving himself between the two of them with the practiced weight of a man who had done this for a decade. He pushed Hector back; the man’s breath hit him like a physical wave, thick with the stench of cheap ale and rot. Ten years of this, breaking up other men’s stupidity. Petr lunged again but Alexis caught him by the shoulder and drove him back into a nearby table. The edge caught the man in the spine, folding him with a sickening grunt that sucked the wind right out of him. That helped. A few boos echoed from the crowd, the gutterfolk disappointed that their free entertainment had been cut short.

Having quelled the riot, Alexis slipped behind the counter and through the narrow door. He reached the stairs leading up to the living quarters, where Maria was waiting for him like a storm front. She stood with her stout arms folded across her chest, her apron already stained with mud and spills, even with hours left in the day.

“You are late,” she spats.

“There was some business,” he replied.

“Damn your business! Filippa has been waiting for you for hours. You cannot keep her, or anyone, waiting like this. If you’re bound to be late, at least have the decency to make everyone else late with you,” Maria went on. You cannot tell them to come at noon and show up when the sun is about to go down. Practice what you preach, Lex, ever heard of that?”

Alexis waved a hand. “I will deal with the rest. You deal with the bar, though I do not know how much good that does anyone, seeing as you cannot stop a pair of fools from throwing hands.”

Maria’s eyes narrowed into slits, her face scrunching up in a scowl that would have withered a lesser man. He moved past her, his boots heavy on the stairs, which creaked in protest.

“Mind your tongue, Lex, or I’ll fetch the tongs and roast it myself,” she growled at his back.

“Sure you will, woman. See to the damned bar, you harridan,” he sighed.

He brushed past before her next word could draw blood and climbed the stairs two at a time, the noise of the tavern fading into a dull, subterranean thrum. He turned the doorknob to his room and pushed the door inward. The space looked the same as it always did. Cramped and smelling of old paper and damp wood except for the occupant in his chair.

A woman sat by his table, likely in her twenties, barely half his age. She was dressed head to toe in black, the fabric heavy and sodden with the Koronow rain. Only the pale, sharp shape of her mouth showed beneath the deep shadow of her hood. Alexis shut the door softly and stayed by the wall; something about her absolute silence made the room feel as small as a confessional.

“Welcome to the Nawrockis’,” he said.

Filippa jerked upright, as if waking from a shallow sleep. She turned her face toward him and gave an awkward bow, half-rising from the chair.

“Keep your seat,” he commanded softly.

“I must thank you for your time.” If she was anxious, she did not betray it by so much as a tremor.

Alexis merely nodded. Filippa looked older than her years, grief had a way of carving lines where they didn’t belong, but he wouldn't have called her frail. There was a tempered steel in her posture; she was handling the weight of it with a grim dignity.

“My condolences for the untimely passing of your husband. Ivan was an upstanding stalwart for your community,” Alexis said. It wasn't an empty pleasantry. Ivan had been a decent man.

“I have heard that you help out those in need.”

“You heard right,” Alexis responded, leaning against the doorframe. “What is it?”

Filippa didn't look at him. She stared at the wall straight ahead, her eyes fixed on the uneven bricks as if she might prise a secret from the mortar. She shook her head, paused, and took a deep breath that seemed to rattle in her lungs.

Alexis tilted his head slightly. “What is it? Do you need work? Are you with child?” If she was, the heavy black fabric of her mourning dress did a fine job of hiding it, though they hadn't been wed long enough for a swelling to be certain.

“No, and no.” Filippa’s hands moved to the armrests, gripping them with a sudden, white-knuckled fervor. It was as if she were trying to draw the very strength of the wood into her bones, though for what purpose, he couldn't yet guess.

“What can I help you with, then?” Alexis asked again. He looked at her fingers, long, skilled hands, patched with the faint scars and stains that were the hallmarks of an army nurse. It was strange for a woman of her profession to seek him out. Nurses weren't wealthy, but they were rarely destitute.

Filippa grimaced. Alexis rolled his tongue along the inside of his mouth, waiting. She waved a hand dismissively, shaking her head as if clearing away a stray thought.

“A place to live,” she asked quietly. “On a nurse’s pay.”

Alexis studied her for a long moment. The rain continued its rhythmic whispering against the glass behind her. “I’ll find one,” he announced at last. “Return in three days.”

“Thank you,” she replied. She stood abruptly, gathering her sodden belongings with a hurried, nervous energy. She made for the door, her skirts rustling against the floorboards.

She paused at the threshold, then turned back. The transformation was jarring; she was smiling now, a bright, brittle expression that didn't reach her haunted eyes. The room felt suddenly, unnaturally still. One drip fell from the eaves. Then another.

“Tell me, Master Nawrocki, are the cherries sweet this year?”

For a second, the air left Alexis’s lungs. The room seemed to tilt on its axis, and the rain outside hushed as if the world were holding its breath. He felt the hot rush of blood to his ears and fought to keep his face a mask of stone.

“I don’t gather your meaning, madam,” he said, his voice sounding thin and distant to his own ears as he struggled to steady it.

“Never mind,” she said, the bright smile never wavering. She skipped off lightly toward the stairs, her footfalls receding. “An idle question.”

Maria’s frame filled the doorway like a barricade before Filippa could leave.. “What cherries did you speak of?”

Alexis leaned back slightly, his eyes never leaving the woman in black. His hand fell to the side of the desk, finding the handle of the top drawer, the one on the right. The wood creaked with a sound like a dry bone snapping. Inside, the heavy pistol lay in its nest of lint and shadow, its steel gleaming dully. He felt the cold, clean weight of it in his mind; six chambers, powder and ball enough to settle any argument Koronow could offer.

He pushed the drawer shut with two fingers.

Filippa laughed softly. The sound was a hollow thing that didn't reach her eyes, if she had any expression at all behind the heavy lace of that veil. “Why, the cherries that you serve in this establishment, mistress,” she said. “I am sure you keep a large and succulent store for your favored guests.”

Maria’s eyes narrowed into slits of cold flint. Her left hand rose, flour still caked pale along the wrist and palm, turning her skin a ghost-white in the dim light. She pointed a finger toward the black silhouette before her.

“Don’t play at wit with me, girl,” Maria snapped.

Alexis spoke before Filippa could offer another barb. “You came to this tavern for a reason,” he said. “Do not be difficult now. It is not a request that I make.”

Filippa’s head tilted, the faintest of motions. Behind her, the pale window light trembled against the shifting dust motes. No one moved. From the tavern below, the muffled clatter of a jug striking wood drifted up, followed by a sudden, heavy silence. The air in the room was thick with the smell of yeast and spilled ale.

Filippa shook her head slowly, the veil brushing against her dark shoulders with a sound like dry leaves. “Would you not like to know what Ivan told me before the cough took his breath?”

The temperature in the room seemed to drop ten degrees. Filippa’s right hand opened and closed in rhythm with her words; deliberate, almost mechanical. On the web between her fingers, Alexis saw it again: that faint, pale crescent etched into the skin.

*Powder burns.*

“He said a shipment came in,” she went on, her voice devoid of the grief she had worn moments ago. “The other man on duty with him, he was checking the weights. Some of the crates carried *cherries*.” The way she spat the word *cherries* made Alexis’s stomach tighten into a hard knot. “Sometimes,” Filippa continued, “the scales gave the strangest numbers. The other man, the one who signed the record, he wrote down the same weights as the others anyway. A professional courtesy, wouldn't you say?”

She stopped there. The silence that followed was absolute. Even the rain seemed to hold its breath, leaving only the soft, taunting tick of the wall clock to fill the void.

Maria coughed once, a dry, jagged sound. Footsteps followed, long, deliberate, cutting through the tension. Yan filled the doorway first, his cloth still slung over one shoulder, looking like a man who had crawled out of a mass grave. His eyes were hollowed out, rimmed with the dark shadows of the sleepless, but his hand was steady. In it, he held a cleaver. He didn’t set it down. He just waited.

Filippa went on as if Yan were merely a piece of the furniture. “The consumption took hold of Ivan a week after the incident,” she said.

Yan eased forward until he was directly behind her. The cleaver’s weight was familiar; he rested the flat of it against his thigh, ready. Maria watched them both without blinking, her lips pressed so thin they had disappeared. For a beat, Filippa held their collective gaze and satisfied with the attention, she went on.

“No one weighs cherries if they come in hospital wagons.”

The grin that crossed Filippa’s mouth then felt fundamentally wrong. Alexis felt it like a cold finger trailing down his spine. He hadn't expected the smile; it made the air in the room feel taut, as if a single word might cause the walls to collapse.

When he finally found his voice, the sound surprised him, harder and more desperate than he had intended. “Why must cherries travel in hospital wagons?” The question landed clumsy and loud in the small space.

Filippa’s face tilted, the veil shadowing the sharp line of her cheek. “Do you intend to be difficult?” Her tone snapped, a blend of polite veneer and razor-edged threat. Then, slower, she added, “We ought to talk. Or your cherries will take you to the bottom of a cell. You are fortunate that I, for the moment, do not wish that to happen.”

“You come to bargain, wench?” Maria grunted, her eyes flicking to Yan’s cleaver.

Filippa looked between them. “I came to see how much further you’d dare to go,” she hissed. “No more cherries through the southern gate. Next time, it will fetch you a cell or a shallow grave in the slurry.”
