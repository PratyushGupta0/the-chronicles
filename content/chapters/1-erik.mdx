The wind had teeth, and it used them. It bit through the seams of Erik Eldholt’s coat, a cold and hungry thing that tasted of salt and iron. Behind him the sea was a restless, grey beast, its waves shattering against black rocks that clawed at the spray. He cast one last look at the horizon, where the sky was the color of a fresh bruise and the clouds hung thick enough to choke the sun. Only thin, dying strands of light bled through the gloom. Erik pulled his hat lower, the brim shielding his eyes from the gale’s hunger, and turned his back on the salt and the foam.


Salzstein loomed ahead. The fortress was a jagged limb of the cliff, carved from the same black, unyielding stone that had birthed the Iron Pact. Its walls were slick with mist and coal-dust. From the lower forges, the rhythmic clang of hammers rose up to meet him, the heartbeat of the island, a sound that never slept. The air was a thick soup of smelted ore, rotting seaweed, and the sharp tang of the brine.


It was the smell of home.


Erik’s fingers slipped into the dark of his coat and found the familiar weight of glass. He drew the bottle out, the brown glass catching the meager light of a sun that had no warmth to give. He watched the bitter beer swirl in the belly of the bottle before he pulled the cork. He drank deep. The warmth spread down his throat, a small fire to dull the edge of the morning. Some days demanded such medicine, and a day like this demanded it more than most.


The boots came next. A steady, tired rhythm of hobnailed leather striking stone. Erik turned his head to watch the columns of men disembarking from the ships below, their coats dark with salt and the sour sweat of the crossing. They moved with a weary, mechanical discipline, every step leaving a wet print that the wind began to erase as soon as it was made. Through the pale grey of the morning, a figure emerged from the mist. It was only an outline at first, but the gait was unmistakable, a long, wiry frame that always seemed a half-beat slower than the world around it. Swen von Skantenveld wore his tricorne hat with a familiar, arrogant tilt, followed by three men with muskets slung over their shoulders and bayonets that caught the dying light like shards of broken glass.


Erik lifted his right hand and raised two fingers in salute. Swen returned it at once, crisp and deliberate. Behind him, the escort moved in perfect unison, their boots striking the cobblestones with a sound like the roll of a drum.


“At ease,” Erik said. His voice cut through the wind, sharp and jagged.


The soldiers did not move. They held their posture with an iron stillness that might have been discipline or merely the stubbornness of the Reach. Swen watched them for a moment, his lips curling in a thin, amused line, before he gave a small nod. The order worked better than the words. The three men loosened their stance all at once, the tension breaking from their shoulders like a long-held breath. Erik’s face split into a grin. He stepped forward with his hand outstretched, and Swen took it in a grip that was firm and warm despite the morning chill.


“I am more glad to see you than you know,” Swen said. His voice was bright, almost boyish, a strange sound against the grey backdrop of the docks. Erik laughed and clapped him on the shoulder. The sound of it was swallowed quickly by the mounting hammer-fall from the lower forges. Up the hill, a rooster offered a thin, lonely crow against the ocean gale. The island was waking.


They started toward the fortress. The path was an old work of cobblestone, the joints newly packed with mortar to bear the weight of the great iron cannons. The fog made the stones slick. Erik moved with a cautious tread, his boots leaving wet prints on the rock. To their right, the black cliffs loomed in the mist, while the sea murmured on their left.


“So,” Erik said after a time. He let his breath out slowly in a grey cloud. The grin tugged at his mouth again, but Swen did not share it. The cheer had drained from Swen’s face as quickly as it had come. He offered only a small, silent nod, his eyes fixed on the dark rise of the fortress ahead.


The houses were huddled together along the hillsides, stone hovels clinging to the basalt wherever the rock left a scrap of dirt to farm. It was a desperate kind of land. The winding roads were already filling with the masses of the capital, a tide of men and women rising to meet the day’s labor.


“You know,” Swen finally said, breaking the silence.


Erik looked up at the citadel. He had been educated within those walls until he was nineteen, and nearly a decade had bled away since then. It loomed larger the closer they drew.


“I can see the reason for this,” Swen mused as they crossed the threshold.


“So can I,” Erik muttered. The musk of the stone hit him as they crossed the threshold, heavy with the scent of damp earth and centuries of dust. It was warmer inside the fortress walls. The air was thick and stagnant, and Erik felt the weight of his coat become superfluous at once. He slid his arms out of the heavy wool, the movement stiff. “I imagine, though, you are not enamoured with the prospect of the campaign.”


They reached the inner doorway. Two soldiers, faces as stony as the walls they guarded, put their shoulders to the iron doors and heaved. The metal groaned on its hinges.


Swen shook his head. “Far from it.”


The doors swung wide, and whatever else Swen might have said was left unspoken. The throne room was small, a cramped space of dark stone that felt cold despite the firewood blazing in the corner. Erik raised his arm in salute, his eyes finding the figure at the far end of the hall. The Sealord, Danvedor Sturmmveld, rose from his seat. It was a throne of iron, hard and jagged, a chair that offered little comfort to any man who sat it.


A large table of white marble dominated the center of the room, a pale island in a sea of shadow. Above the throne hung the banners. The kraken of the Iron Pact claimed the center, flanked by the mermaid of the fleets on the left and the ornate axe of the army on the right. A map was spread across the marble, its edges weighted down by iron daggers. Men huddled over the vellum, their voices nothing more than a quiet murmur that died away as the newcomers approached.


Admiral Gunther von Voll occupied the space by the window, his back to the room as he stared out over the sea. His hands were clasped behind his back, his fingers interlaced. He wore no beard, but his moustache was a thick, jet-black streak that curled upward at the ends. When he turned, the lines cutting deep into his face spoke of a lifetime spent squinting against the salt and the sun. He said nothing.


Lord Trebor Serkisch, the administrator of the army, cleared his throat. The sound was sharp, and the last of the conversation died. A sudden gust of wind rattled the windowpanes, carrying the sharp scent of salt into the room.


Sealord Danvedor raised his hand. His frame was stout and powerful, commanding the room by his presence alone. When he spoke, his voice was a harsh rasp, like a knife scraping over stone.


“Today, we gather here to lay claim to what destiny has always held for us,” Danvedor said. No one moved. No one drew breath. “Our hand is forced by the insolence of our foe, yet none must believe that the crushing of his impropriety will be the extent of our ambition. The time has come.” He raised his voice, the sound echoing off the dark walls. “The time has come for the Iron Pact to sweep forth from our isles, which struggle and break under the weight of our numbers.”


A chorus of ayes rose from the gathered men, a low rumble of steel and grit. The Sealord raised his hand again, and the room fell into a silence so absolute that the crackle of the fire sounded like a thunderclap.


“And thus it is that the Iron Pact marches to war,” Danvedor roared, his eyes bright with a dangerous light. “Sons of the Reach, raise your spirits. In incense and in iron.”


The men filed out of the chamber like a funeral procession once the talking was done. Erik had heard those grand, hollow words many a time, and they still tasted of ash, having naught to do with the grim iron purpose that drove the Pact. He made his way around the fortress to the crag where the grey stone bit into the sky and began the slow, familiar ascent. His fingers found the cracks by memory, pulling his weight up the cold rock until his breath came in ragged ghosts of steam.


He was perched upon a small outcrop when the heavy boots found him. His name was still there, carved into the stone a decade past, looking like a scar that refused to heal. Erik took a long drag of a cigar, inhaling the smoke deep into his lungs until it merged with the black smog drifting over Salzstein from the great foundries. To the east, the rising sun turned the soot in the air into dancing motes of gold, but the rock at his back kept Erik rooted in the shadows.


A hand clapped his shoulder hard enough to rattle his teeth. “Son of a—” Erik started, but the rest was lost as Swen snatched the cigar from his fingers and put it to his own mouth. Swen took a deep pull and exhaled a long, grey cloud into the wind. “Good make,” he said, his voice like grinding stones. Erik only sighed and turned his gaze back to the ocean. He watched the white foam boil against the shore, silent and brooding, while Swen held his peace. They waited for a great wave to shatter itself against the rocks before the tall man spoke again.


“What do you think of it all?” he asked.


“The time is here,” Erik replied, his eyes locked on the spray. He did not need to turn to know Swen was shaking his head.


“The Marshalls, the Daryl Sound,” Swen said, keeping his voice low against the whistling wind. “There is land plenty for our people there.”


“Land?” Erik spat into the surf. “Rocks and more godforsaken rocks. You cannot plough basalt. You can only starve on it.”


Swen fell silent for a long moment. Above them, the smoke from the great towers rose straight and true into the morning air, for the wind was weaker than was its wont, though eventually the soot spread into long, thin fingers that clawed at the heavens. Black fingers, Erik thought, like the hands of a drowned man reaching for the light.


Swen snapped his jaw shut and gestured toward the jagged horizon with a grunt of sudden anger. “And what are these, then,” he asked, his voice thick with a sulking bitterness. “Naught but barren rock and blasted cliffs, yet we live on them well enough, do we not.”


Erik looked toward his friend as his friend handed the cigar back. He took the leaf and held it between two fingers, leaning his weight back on one hand against the cold stone of the crag. He locked his gaze with Swen’s own, and when he spoke his voice was harsher than it had been, the volume rising to match the roar of the sea below. “We did not build our strength to struggle on this. We did not forge the Pact to break our backs on basalt and brine.”


Swen pursed his lips, his face taking on the look of a disappointed mother of five, a mask of weary disapproval he wore far too often of late. He offered no reply, though Erik was certain the man heard him well enough. They watched The Lady of the Reach pulling into the moorings, a great ship-of-the-line with her sails bellied out, leading three frigates in her wake like a mother duck with her brood.


Erik looked back out over the grey expanse of the sea, watching the ships come home to roost. As the shadow of the fortress loomed over them, his jaw tightened until the bone ached and his hand closed into a fist so hard the knuckles turned as white as the sea foam.


“You know what they call us in Elysia?”


A shrug was the only answer, or so it felt from the shifting of weight at his back. “What,” came the flat reply.


“Sea beggars.”


He felt the other man cock his head. A moment passed, silent save for the roar of the water, and then a short bark of laughter broke the air. “We eat better than they do,” his companion shot back, still chuckling.


“That is what they say, that we must needs beg for our grain,” Erik growled, his fingers finding a loose pebble and flinging it out into the grey expanse. It vanished into the churning surf with no splash that he could discern, swallowed by the salt.


A long sigh followed, a sound like the wind through dead leaves. “You cannot explain sense to those who have no eyes to see it. We trade for our food, same as any merchant.”


“Yet they call us beggars nonetheless.”


Erik continued, when he heard no response. “I was in Elysia last year, an attache to the Duchy of the fat lord Dravone. One of those evenings, they sat about talking of some petty war or another, the sort of squabble that lords enjoy. I offered them advice, a sensible course, the sort of thing we are taught at the academy. I was respectful, as a man must be in such company.” His jaw tightened until the words became a rasping growl. “I heard a man whisper gutterborn. Others whispered sea beggar. They did not even have the grace to hide their scorn.”


Swen pursed his lips, his face a mask of hard lines.


“It is not just about the land. The gods know we have need of it, and a place where the soil gives more than iron and ore would be a heaven to our people. But it is about dignity as well.”


“And will conflict earn us respect?” Swen asked. Quietly.


“Respect, fear, call it what you will, it matters not to me. It will earn us dignity.”


His friend looked toward the sky once, watching the black smoke smudge the clouds, and then gave a slow and solemn nod. “Gunther has called the council for tonight.”


“The Fourth Fleet has the Maelics mapped, down to the very pebbles on the shore,” he replied. He began to dust the soot and salt from his uniform, his brows still furrowed in a dark scowl, yet his thoughts were already drifting toward the council chamber.


The two of them drifted towards the council chamber soon enough.


The map of the Maelic Isles was spread wide across the heavy oak, its edges weighted down by iron daggers and salt-stained brass. He bent over the parchment, a sliver of thin charcoal held between his calloused fingers. It was a handsome thing, the fruit of months spent harrying the coast and sailing through mists that tasted of doom, every crevice and inlet marked with a steady hand. Erik took a quiet pride in the work, and by the look of the arched eyebrow the Admiral wore, the work had found its mark. The isle of Ikezaki was a sprawling beast of stone, yet their attention was fixated upon the narrow peninsula that jutted out from its eastern flank like a broken finger.


The peninsula looked a formidable foe, commanding the only true landings on the whole damned island and shielded by the fortress that shared its name. He traced a line along the northern coast, marking a stretch of jagged shore. “Here is the third battery,” he said, casting a pointed look at the Grand Admiral.


The older man stood with hands clasped behind his back, his face a mask of weathered leather. “We know as much,” he replied, his voice sounding like gravel ground beneath a boot.


He continued his tally of the defenses, pointing out three outposts they had sniffed out during their scout runs. One sat to the north, one to the east, and a third guarded the southern approach. “Ikezaki itself holds the eastern beaches, and the northern and southern paths are watched too. We cannot hope to take them in a sudden onset.


The Admiral furrowed his brow and walked a slow circle around the map, his gaze coming to rest on the northern outpost of Ido. “You harassed them?” he asked, never lifting his eyes from the parchment.


“Ido was the slowest to respond to fire,” he replied. Voll nodded and narrowed his eyes, reaching out to take a dagger. He pointed at a road that snaked up toward the fort, a narrow, treacherous path that wound through the hills like a dying snake.


“What do you know of this Eldholt?” the Admiral asked.


He felt the weight of several gazes then. His friend was watching him, as was Trystan Horn. The latter was a stout man, possessed of a thick, bushy thicket of a beard that made him look like some ancient wood-bear judging a cub. “It is the only road that supplies Ido,” he answered, more sure of that than he was of his own soul.


“Horn,” Swen said, his own eyes fixed upon the southern strip of the map where the fort of Miyumi sat, the smallest of the three batteries.


“Hmm?” the veteran grunted, turning his heavy frame to follow the younger man’s stare.


“You reckon we can take Miyumi in open assault?” The question was tossed out casually as his friend leaned against the timber of the wall. “I will need cover, but it looks more open to a hard strike.” He reached for a bowl of oranges on the table, grasping one with a lanky hand.


Horn scratched at his chin, the sound of his nails against the grey whiskers filling the cabin. He said nothing for a long beat. He leaned in then, his shadow falling across the coast. “Miyumi is the weakest of the three, aye, but it is also the least valuable. I do not see why we should bleed good men for such a pittance.”


The Admiral took a deep breath, his lips curling slowly into a smile that held no mirth. “How long is the march overland, do you think? From Miyumi to this road?” He placed a long finger upon the path to Ido.


Skantenveld grinned, the orange peel staining his fingers. “Two days, mayhap. If we face no opposition and the men are driven with a whip.”


“So we storm Miyumi in the south, and then Swen strikes overland to cut the road that supplies Ido. Once Ido is cut and starved of powder, we can storm it by sea too.” The admiral said.


Horn moved his hands from his beard to the small of his back, his voice a low rumble. “A contested landing at Miyumi. Aye. Aye. We may storm it, but do not pretend it will be a clean business. Their guns will rake the beach. Half our boats could founder before a single boot touches the sand.”


A deep sigh echoed through the room. “I do not ask you to smash the boats into the stone,” Swencountered. “I ask only that you keep their eyes bolted upon yourself. I will drive the landing craft right into the estuary. If you do your job well enough, their guns will have no space to turn against us.”


The veteran captain smarted at the words, his teeth gritting together. “I will take the Mermaid with me.”


“A ship of the line?” the Admiral asked, his voice soft with caution.


“Damn me if I will risk this without her,” Horn growled, standing his ground.


Erik had learned long ago that Horn was not a man to be budged once his mind was set, not unless one had a month to spare for the task. The Mermaid would sail. He spoke up then, his voice cutting through the tension. “And why would they not interrupt this jolly march north out of the goodness of their hearts?” He allowed himself a small, sharp grin at the jibe.


The Admiral shrugged. “I will divert their attention by placing myself against Ikezaki itself. I shall shatter what sloops they have stowed in that harbor. They will try to slaughter us on the beach, but if they bleed themselves dry on my guns, the march from Miyumi to Ido’s lines may find its mark. Horn, you shall support the landing on the southern beaches at Miyumi. Erik, you are to oppose Ido, and I shall stand against Ikezaki itself. On land, the word of the landing commander shall be law, and his orders may even supersede my own. Use your discretion if the two should clash.”


“Aye, Admiral,” he replied with a grin.


“Four ships of the line and a swarm of frigates should suffice. Their road to Ido cannot supply them with shells enough to withstand a sustained fire. They will break.”


Silence fell over the cabin for a time as each man weighed the cost of the iron they were about to spend. Horn gave a slow nod of assent. “Will the Mermaid run aground in those shallows?”


“At high water she clears the bar. At low, she grounds. You must needs time the landing to the tide,” he answered.
