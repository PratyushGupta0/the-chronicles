Ash hissed beneath Igor’s boot as he crushed the last ember of the watch-fire into the dirt. The light winked out like a dying eye, leaving only the sharp, bitter scent of burnt oak and cold iron to greet the dawn. He straightened his back, feeling the bite of the morning wind as it snapped the blue standard above the command tent, the white wolf of the First Carolean Battalion, teeth bared in a mid-lunge that never ended.

Igor turned his gaze to his company commanders. There was Misha, built like a siege tower; Karol, whose eyes were hollowed out by the theft of sleep; Wilhelm, with his long, unkempt hair; and Cem, slim and watchful.

"Preparations are complete," Igor stated.

Wilhelm and Cem offered brief nods. Wilhelm’s was sharp and economical, the movement of a man who begrudged every wasted second; Cem’s was more of a bow, a formal, foreign gesture that felt out of place in the mud of the Reach.

Karol lingered, his jaw set in a hard line, waiting until Igor’s eyes locked onto his own. "There were problems during the watch. One of the Bellaquan regiments."

Igor’s brow twitched, a faint ripple of irritation. "Stierna’s lot?"

Karol looked surprised, his eyebrows rising. "You know the man? Count Stierna?"

Igor allowed himself a small, crooked smile, a brief flash of white in the gloom. "Do not trouble yourself with who I know, Karol. What happened?"

Karol sighed, the sound heavy with the weariness of a man who spent his night nursing the pride of fools. "One of my officers had too much spirit in him, both in his heart and in his drink. Pactman. One of Stierna’s pups, some golden-haired boy, called him a sea-beggar to his face." He paused, shifting his weight from one mud-caked boot to the other. "I wouldn't have bothered you, but the Bellaquan was some baron’s whelp. I had to step in and break the peace before steel started singing."

Misha let out a loud, rasping laugh that broke the morning’s stillness like a falling branch. Wilhelm’s mouth tightened at the insult, his fingers worrying the first button of his coat, turning it, pressing it flat, turning it again in a rhythmic, nervous obsession. The faint lines around his eyes remained frozen.

Igor watched the play of shadow on their faces before speaking evenly. "Well, aside from the petty pride of baronets, are we ready to move?"

Karol offered a single, stiff nod.

"The Elysians," Igor mused, his voice dropping an octave, "have never been overly fond of foreigners in their backyard."

Wilhelm’s Ostravian was thick and guttural, the consonants of his father’s native Hemlig scraping against his throat like gravel. "They seem to reserve a special, sharp spite for Reachmen," he said, his eyes fixed on some distant, invisible point beyond Igor’s shoulder.

*They would have to lump it. More than a few among the Caroleans have Hemlig blood, including the commander. *

Igor pulled his timepiece from his pocket, the silver cool against his palm.

He found August soon enough, standing amidst the fluttering maps and the scent of stale tobacco. Ermon was there too, the commander of the Second Battalion.

“Igor,” August spoke through the blackened pipe clenched firmly between his teeth.

“Yes.”

August drew slow and deep. “I talked to Lukas last night.”

He paused, the silence in the tent broken only by the restless snapping of the canvas as the wind pressed hard against it.

“The detailed orders will reach you within the hour,” August went on. “Read them immediately. But I’ll outline the campaign in broad strokes. Jurgen is already on the move, marching north and hugging the western coastline. He’s to lay siege to the fortress at the mouth of the Gangliano and bottle them up.”

He shifted his weight. “We’ll follow Lukas with three-quarters of the host along the eastern coast. There’s a loyalist field army lurking somewhere between the ridges there, and Lukas intends to find them.”

Ermon tilted his head. “And our role in this dance?”

“We hold the plateau at Pietrallo. Zymoski’s division will be to our north,. Lukas expects the main engagement to be even further north, closer to Porto Salve.”

Ermon gave a short laugh. “So we’re the rearguard.”

He shrugged, a brief motion of his shoulders. “Ideally, yes,”

Igor’s jaw worked once. “Ideally?”

“Ideally, we will not be forced to engage in the field,” he said “But we’ll have support. An army from the House of Rossi is marching even now to join our banners at Pietrallo.”

The march to Pietrallo remained calm enough. They arrived in the next few days, and positioned their camp. It was one of the mornings after they arrived, that Igor finally found the time to visit the town’s chapel.

Pietrallo wasn’t a large town. Igor guessed perhaps a thousand souls. It sat on the crest of a low hill-too broad for dignity, too bare for charm. A thin morning haze clung to it, soft and blue, as though the air itself hadn’t yet decided to wake. August had given orders for fortifications. The men were already at it-spades biting into damp earth, boots thudding, the scrape of iron on stone steady and grim. The smell of churned soil and sweat rose in slow waves. Igor moved past them toward the cathedral, its pale outline cutting through the mist.

It was a fine building, finer than a place like Pietrallo deserved. The spire reached maybe sixty feet, its cross bent slightly westward by age or wind. Arched windows lined both sides, tall, and deliberate, almost arrogant in their grace. The stained glass still caught what little light there was, bleeding soft color over the white stone. Scenes from the Passion and the Resurrection glowed faintly, ghost-like. Igor’s boots echoed in the nave as he entered. The doorway itself was an arch of coiled pillars,  kind of work done by men who built for God rather than men. Inside, the air was cool and close. He took off his cap. The friar would come soon.

The sound came first, an inhuman scream of metal tearing air, then the world broke. A black iron mass punched through the stained glass, the entire far window erupting outward in a shower of color. The missile hit stone fifteen feet from him, the impact deafening. Shards ripped through the air; a hail of glass struck his shoulders, stinging through coat and cloth. He was already moving, body folding low, instinct dragging him to the ground as light and dust exploded around him. The crash roared through the cathedral; stone, glass, iron, sound all colliding into one long note that seemed to vibrate inside his skull. He tasted dust. Blood. The smell of lime and gunpowder filled his lungs. He stayed there for a heartbeat, breath rasping against the cold floor, before forcing himself up. The cut on his cheek stung now, sharp and wet. Blood spattered the flagstones, a small red thread running toward the altar.

One last glance at the altar: broken pews, plaster falling from the walls, stained glass splintered on the flagstones. He clenched his fist until his nails drew blood from his palm.

Outside, shouting, running, the thump of boots on gravel. He pushed against the door with his shoulder; it groaned, then gave. Light poured in, harsh and wrong.

His heart hammered in his throat, breath scraping as he ran. The wolf banner broke through the smoke, white shape against the churned soil, still flying, still whole. His men were there, forming lines across the shallow earthworks, the ground not yet dry from the morning dew. Someone lay facedown near the half-finished trench, one leg twitching. Two more wounded were being hauled back by their collars, boots dragging furrows behind them. But the rest-his line-looked steady enough. They were getting into order, shakily, but fast.

*Five more damned minutes. That's all we need. *

The guns fired again, closer now. The sound rolled across the plateau in thick, guttural waves, shoving the air out of his lungs. He stopped a hundred yards from the wolf, chest heaving, turned, scanned the ridge. To his left, he caught sight of Ermo. Aalready shouting himself hoarse, trying to force the third and fourth battalions into some shape. Their lines were uneven, banners still tangled, men bounding to their lines.

A figure broke from his own formation, sprinting toward him. Igor grabbed him by the arm, spun him around.

“Go to the third and the fourth!” he barked. “Find out how long they need-ask anyone, ask the officers Go!”

The man saluted, breathless.

“Go!” Igor roared.

The boy tore off at once, cutting across the lines, vanishing behind the smoke curling low over the earth.

Igor turned back. His own guns had opened up in short, angry bursts, the thunder echoing off the cathedral’s ruined walls. The first round hit too short, the second landed somewhere out in the field. The smell of spent powder rolled through the camp, sharp and metallic. Men were shouting, muskets snapping into place. The rhythm of the artillery picked up-faster, louder, until it was less sound than pressure, hammering through his ribs.

He could feel the attack coming straight for them. The east was alive now, the horizon flickering in red and smoke. They wouldn’t wait long. His battalion would take the first blow.

Misha caught sight of him and gave a curt nod, quick but deliberate, before turning back to the men. Igor staggered to the standard, bent double for a heartbeat, his breath coming ragged and hot. “Report,” he snapped, the word breaking on his tongue.

“Enemy force in the thousands. Were supposed to be friendly. Turncoats. ,” Misha panted. His face was slick with grime,. “Our companies formed behind the earthworks.”

Igor grunted, straightened, squinting toward the east. “Casualties?”

“Cem’s wounded,” Misha replied, not hesitating. “Arda’s taken command of the Fourth company”

Igor’s jaw tightened. The ground near them jumped-a round slammed into the earthworks ahead, blasting a trench of dirt skyward. Clods of mud and rock came down like hail. Igor felt the sting of grit against his cheek, wiped it away without thinking. He shut his eyes for a second, thinking, counting. The slope was shallow. The frontage narrow. Good for defense. But if they broke through the center, they’d roll them before the flanks could adjust.

“Misha,” he rasped.

His lieutenant turned, waiting. “Hmm?”

“Your company’s the reserve,” Igor ordered. “Hold them back, hundred yards. If the line breaks, you fill the gap. Nothing else.”

“Understood.”

“Zygmunt,” Igor barked, pointing down the line. “The second, third, and fourth companies  form the front. Keep them tight. Depth over width.”

Zygmunt’s voice rose immediately, echoing the order down the slope. Men began shifting, the ripple of movement catching through the ranks-mud, muskets, and steel finding rhythm in the chaos. Igor bent low again, coughing, the dust and smoke cutting into his throat until it burned. He spat, wiped his mouth on his sleeve, and forced air into his lungs.

Misha was already moving. He waved his men back, the First Company withdrawing just beyond the earthworks-an even hundred yards, maybe more-forming up in a staggered line. The rest of the battalion braced at the trench’s lip, bayonets glinting, muskets raised.

For a moment, Igor allowed himself to breathe. Relief, quick and ugly, shivered through him. They were not broken. Not yet. The sound changed then-another thunder, heavier, closer. His own guns were firing. The first shots overshot, shrieking into the fields below, but the next began to find their range. From the ridge, the guns had clean sightlines. Roundshot tore through the air and vanished into the mass of men crawling out from the far treeline. The first impacts burst in smoke and screams.

More artillery joined the rhythm-Ermon’s, perhaps or the third and fourth finally ready to advance.  Each report rolled through the air, shaking the windows of the cathedral behind him. The smell of powder grew thicker, sharp and metallic, filling the lungs like a second air. Igor watched the enemy lines swelling through the haze-dense blocks of color and motion, banners bobbing, the glint of bayonets flashing under the sun. They were beginning their climb.

It was the runner. The same boy he’d sent scurrying off minutes earlier. The lad’s face was pale beneath the grime, eyes wide. Fear first, then resolve. Igor unclenched his hand, exhaled through his nose, grimacing. “What?”

The boy straightened, voice too tight for his age. “I found General August,”. The soldier thrusted an arm forward.  “He gave me this.”

Igor snatched the letter, fingers slick with dirt. He broke the seal with his thumb and unfolded it, the paper damp and half-torn from the runner’s sweat. Two lines-nothing more.

*Hold. Ermon ordered forward in support..*

That was all. It would have to be enough.

He looked up sharply. “Zygmunt!” he shouted over the roar of the guns. “Mark this position. Rally point for the Second Battalion!”

Zygmunt was already moving, the signal flags cutting through the haze in quick, clipped sweeps. Men near the standard straightened; orders were passed down the line in short barks.

Igor turned back to the runner, the boy still standing rigid, chest heaving. “Which company?”

“Third,” he managed, glancing east. He scanned the slope until he spotted the standard of his company, a smudge of white in the smoke.

He raised his arm-four fingers extended in salute-then took off, splashing through the muck toward the line. The next cannon report swallowed him whole, and Igor lost sight of him.

The ground shuddered again.

“Fire by platoon!” Igor bellowed over the cannonade. His voice vanished into the roar, but the signal flags caught it, flashing the order down the line. The answer came at once-a shattering crash that rolled across the field. The half-built earthworks leapt under the strain, spitting mud and dust into the air. Muskets barked in measured rhythm, one platoon after another, each volley folding into the next. The rhythm was relentless, mechanical. The smell of powder rose in choking waves, thick and bitter, catching in the lungs. Smoke curled low along the trenches, turning men into silhouettes-dark, jerking shapes moving through a storm of sound. The ground shook as another battery opened up to the north, and the sky filled with black flecks of soil and iron.

“Keep it steady!” he roared, though his throat was already raw. The men barely heard him now, their faces gray with soot, their mouths working wordlessly as they bit cartridges and rammed powder home. The clack of ramrods was constant, drowned only by the next crash of volley fire.

Then the enemy answered. Canister. A scream of metal split the air, and the earthworks spat dirt and blood together. Shards of iron and stone sliced the air, hot enough to sear where they grazed flesh. Men fell wordless, dropped their weapons, or staggered back clutching at wounds that gushed like ruptured skins of wine. One went down near Igor’s feet; another, still standing, had half his ear torn away but didn’t seem to notice, still firing, still reloading.

Igor pressed his spyglass to his eye. The smoke made it almost useless-just gray shapes, flashes, the suggestion of movement. Still, he could see the lines, dim outlines of men advancing through the haze. Tight columns, banners dipping and lifting like black waves. Then he saw it clearly: the echelon forming left, pressing toward the lower slope. Clever bastards. The earthworks were weakest there.

*Rossi.*

Igor’s jaw tightened. He let the glass drop against his chest, breathing hard. “First Company!” he roared. “Reinforce the left flank-at your discretion!” His voice cracked with the effort. The signalers caught it, relayed it, their flags slicing through the haze. Somewhere beyond the curtain of smoke, Misha would see. Hopefully.

The guns kept talking. Each blast seemed closer than the last. The air felt heavy, hot, metallic-the smell of iron and sweat so thick he could taste it. The enemy was closing now-he could tell by sound alone. The shots came sharper, the ricochet of balls snapping through the mud, the screams faster. Eighty yards, maybe less. He heard the hiss and thunk of a ball hitting flesh, saw a man’s chest burst red beside him, the blood spraying up like the petals of a red flower, too vivid, too brief.

The first dark shapes broke through the haze to his rear-Ermon’s men, their coats soaked in mud and powder. They came in staggered files, faces hollowed by smoke, but the sight of them drew breath back into Igor’s lungs. The hedgehog banner flapped once above the line, tattered but visible. He exhaled slowly. Relief was a strange thing-it felt like pain easing, not joy rising. Ermon’s troops slipped into the trenchline, spreading thin behind his own. The shouts of officers mingled with the cough of the guns, orders barely rising above the roar. The line thickened, uneven, alive again.

He listened. Watched. The rhythm had changed-volleys now came unevenly from across the slope, flaring and dying like breath through a furnace. The enemy’s fire was broken, confused, platoons firing without order. Somewhere to the left, a battery let loose, the boom rolling across the ridge like surf. He raised the glass again, squinting through the smoke, trying to see where the line bent or broke.

Then it came. A moment of serenity in the chaos. The guns waited for the next shell to be loaded.. Ramrods were sent down barrels. And for one holy second there was peace.

“Crack.” A single sound, deep as thunder, tearing across the battlefield. The air itself seemed to jump. His heart lurched in his chest.

“Crack.” Another-closer, heavier.

He froze, the spyglass half-lowered, fingers slick with sweat. The sound didn’t belong to his line-it was a different rhythm, deeper, fuller. He raised the glass again, searching the field. The right flank-nothing but smoke and flashes.

“Crack”

The third came. Closer. He felt it in his teeth before he heard it.

This time he knew. The corners of his mouth twitched upward, a small, feral grin forming against his will. He swung the glass left.

Through the rolling smoke he saw them-the Third and Fourth battalions, ghosts emerging from the mist. They’d moved unseen through the low ground, the fog cloaking their approach until now. Forty yards off the enemy flank, the first volley had hit like a hammer. Three crashes in as many seconds, each one ripping through the Rossi line.

The enemy formation folded where they stood. Even through the haze he could see it-ranks buckling, men flung backward, red mist rising in sudden bursts. The Rossi flank looked torn open, as if the earth itself had clawed through them. Another volley lit the mist from within, orange fire through a gray veil. The roar came a moment later, heavy and alive.

Igor lowered the glass. His chest rose and fell once, hard.

“Charge!” he shouted, voice raw. Ramrods were shoved home with the ferocity of men who had nowhere left to go; those not yet loaded held their fire, fingers white on the stocks.

The screaming kept rising. It rose from the slope in ragged waves-cries, shouts, the raw sound of men meeting steel. Somewhere below, August’s forces had struck the flank in full. The hillside was alive with motion, the fog trembling with it. The air reeked of burnt powder and iron and something worse.

The two battalions were formed into three clean ranks. “Fire at thirty paces!” Igor shrieked. “Then bayonets! Know no fear!”.
