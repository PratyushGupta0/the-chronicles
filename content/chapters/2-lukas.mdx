The sun was a white-hot hammer, and Lukas felt it burning through his skin with a ferocity he hadn’t known in Ostravia. The Elysians seemed indifferent to the heat, moving through the swelter with a bronze-skinned ease that he envied and loathed in equal measure. He drove his spurs into the horse’s flanks, forcing a bit of pace out of the beast. The road had been chosen for him, a winding path flanked by groves of lemon and apple trees. The scent of the fruit was heavy and sweet, a cloying, alien perfume that made his head swim.

Lukas gawked at the abundance. There were dozens of carts arrayed along the verges, their wheels caked in the dry, pale dust of the province. Around them the vendors screamed themselves hoarse for their wares, lemons and tart cherries, strange mangoes and wines. And cloth-of-gold and fine silver ware that would gladden the kitchen of any king. He weaved his mount carefully through the press of the marketplace, where the throng was so thick he could smell the salt of their sweat.

He pulled the reins with a jerk, harder than he should have, and the horse whined in protest before coming to a jarring halt. When Lukas hopped down, his knees screamed. Old, he thought, the word tasting like bile. Too damn old for this sun. He swayed as he found his footing, then wedged his frame into the mass of bodies.

“Apples! Fresh apples!” the vendor brayed, his voice a rhythmic croak. The fruit was a deep, lurid red, looking so much like pools of fresh blood that Lukas felt a phantom ache in his sword-arm.

As he dug into his purse, he felt the weight of a thousand stares. His skin was pale as a winter drift, sticking out like a white banner among the sun beaten faces of the commoners. If his skin didn’t give him away, his Ostravian coat certainly did. It was a beacon to every cutpurse and scoundrel in the square, marking him as a man with coin that needed parting.

He did not care. He pulled out an Ostravian sovereign and held it toward the vendor.

The man stopped mid-shout. His eyes locked onto the coin. It was no Prevezan piece, but it was large, heavy, and made of solid, honest silver. The vendor snatched it from Lukas’s palm and shoved it into his pocket with a frantic, furtive motion, his head whipping left and right to see who had noticed. Without a word, he grabbed a basket and began heaving apples into it, not even bothering to count the tally.

The man’s face split into a bright, desperate smile. He thrust the overflowing basket toward Lukas.

Lukas took the fruit, the weight of it solid in his hands, and vaulted back into his saddle. He nearly sent an old woman sprawling into the dirt in his haste. She found her feet and shrieked something in a railing, gutter Elysian. Lukas spoke only the Elysian of the courts, but he didn’t need a translator to know she had just cursed his mother, his sons, and the horse he rode on.

A fist caught Lukas on the shoulder with the force of a hammer, nearly sending him spilling from his saddle. Only the high cantle of his seat kept him mounted. He swung around, hand instinctively dropping toward his steel, only to meet the wide, mocking grin of Jurgen. The escort had arrived.

“You thought you had slipped your leash, did you not, Lukas?” Jurgen asked, his mount pulling in stride beside the commander’s. Behind him, a dozen cuirassiers moved with practiced precision, their horses forming a wedge that parted the commoners like a prow through water.

Lukas didn’t answer. He simply shrugged and bit into one of the red apples. He had seen beauty in women and steel, but never in fruit, yet there was no other word for the riot of sugar and tartness that exploded across his tongue. He offered the half-eaten remains to his second-in-command. Jurgen ignored the gesture, his eyes instead wandering toward the village women passing by. They were slender and pretty, carrying pails and baskets.

“The Commander of the Ostravian Expeditionary Force for the Restoration of Order in Elysia, Lukas Podolski, haggling over fruit in a gutter market,” Jurgen said, shaking his head.

“I did not haggle,” Lukas grunted, his mouth still half-full of pulp. “And do you not think you find too much to say for a second-in-command?”

Jurgen kept his gaze on the women. “Let me think on that for a moment.” He waited a beat, then gave a sharp, singular shake of his head. “No.”

The playfulness vanished in an instant. Jurgen reached into the pocket of his grey coat, and when his hand emerged, it held a sealed letter. His face seemed to harden, the languid seat in his saddle turning to iron. He had a talent for it, becoming a different man the moment the business of the crown intervened.

“The Queen,” Jurgen said, the word short and clipped.

Lukas took the vellum, handing the heavy basket of apples off to a retainer without looking. He broke the seal and let his eyes track over the short, sharp lines of script. He read it once, his face as unreadable as the stone of a fortress, then folded the paper and tucked it into his own grey coat, a garment that matched the salt-and-pepper of his beard and hair.

“She arrives here soon. That is all,” Lukas spoke, his voice low.

The company rode onwards, deeper into the heart of Bellaqua. The city lived up to its name; the water in the harbor was a rich, shimmering turquoise, crowded with ships from every corner of the known world. Massive barges sat low in the swells, laden with fine steel ingots and heavy tools from the Pact. Beside them, Novogradian traders unloaded thick furs and winter coats, while the air grew heavy with the pungent, head-turning scent of spices from the Far East. Lukas watched it all, the fermented camel milk from the Shattered Isles and the dozens of foreign flags he didn’t recognize, all of them tangled in a web of trade he barely understood.

“Excited to meet Daron?” Jurgen asked, shifting in his saddle.

Lukas took his time answering. To him, the politics of the south were a court dance, and he had never had the feet for it. In truth, the arrival of Queen Alexandra would be a mercy; it would rid him of the burden of diplomacy and let him return to the steel.

“The Duke is a man of little morals,” Lukas replied. He looked around at the sun-drenched streets. “Though I suppose I would have no morals either if I lived in a place so plentiful as this. The food, the people… it softens a man.”

Jurgen let out a short, raspy laugh. “Well, he has invited us to help his little revolt. One doesn’t call for Ostravian bayonets if they are a particularly upright character.”

They were speaking in Ostravian now, earning them sharp stares from the common folk. Yet the people here seemed happy enough, despite the coming war. They were laughing, flirting, and singing in the heat. A man stood on a corner with an accordion, his voice a gravelly ruin, but the tune was bright. Lukas couldn’t catch the words, but he knew it wasn’t a song of loss. A dirge would not suit the scent of fresh bread and olives that hung in the air.

“He could have legitimate grievances against the Elysian Emperor,” Lukas mused, watching the accordion player.

Jurgen scrunched his face in doubt. “That might be true. But this operation reeks of political maneuvering. Forty thousand troops are not a gesture of aid, Lukas. That is an entire allied army.”

Lukas considered the words. He leaned back, the leather of his saddle creaking, and shook his head. “I will ask Alexandra when she arrives. I am a soldier, not a minister.”

“Do what you like,” Jurgen smirked, his eyes tracking a merchant’s daughter. “I am telling you, this is a land grab.”

Lukas laughed then, a dry sound. “Well, if some of the grabbed land goes to us, I suppose I can find my peace with it.”

The crowds began to thin as Preveza Castle, the seat of Duke Daron Preveza, finally rose up before them. It was a monstrous thing of white marble, the stone polished until it shone like a mirror in the sun. The windows were a riot of stained glass, the colors so vivid they hurt the eyes. From the road, Lukas couldn’t make out the scenes in the glass, but the sculptures lining the approach were breathtaking. He passed a massive depiction of Saint Michal slaying the dragon, carved with such precision that he could see the strain in the Saint’s muscles and the terror in the horse’s eyes.

“I examined the living quarters for the force,” Jurgen spoke again, his tone turning professional as they neared the gates. “Everything is in order. The Prevezas are rich, even by the standards of this coast.”

“That they are,” Lukas agreed.

The day passed in a haze of ink and parchment, a slow death by bureaucracy that left Lukas more exhausted than a week on the march. When the morning finally broke, he found himself high in the saddle, encased in the heavy weight of ceremonial plate with another ceremonial longsword slapping against his thigh.

They gawked. The men of Bellaqua, their wives, and their children were packed shoulder to shoulder along the Ducal causeway, tens of thousands of them spilling out of open windows and clinging to marble balconies like barnacles to a hull. They were drunk on cheap wine and the heat of the day, their voices rising in a shimmer of noise that seemed to vibrate against the stone. From the harbor quarter the bells began to toll, the sound mingling with the cries of gulls and the thick scents of roasted chestnuts, sea-salt, and the heavy perfume of the nobility. The sun was a bright coin in the sky, not yet cruel, turning the square into a canvas of red-tiled roofs and pale, shimmering marble.

Lukas looked toward the pavilion. It was a gleaming spire of white silk, its edges stitched with enough gold to buy a province. The crest of House Preveza hung from every corner, a rising sun upon a sea of blue. Beneath the silk stood Duke Daron himself, draped in robes of matching hue and flanked by household guards. Behind the Duke, the courtiers were a spill of emerald, sapphire, and pearl, a sea of gemstones pretending an indifference they did not feel as they leaned forward to see the steel.

Lukas adjusted the fit of his coat. The black wool was heavy and unyielding, drinking the sun until it felt like a furnace against his skin, yet it lent him the gravitas the day demanded. His gloves creaked as he tightened his grip on the reins. The murmurs of the crowd pressed in on him, a tide of whispers and laughter punctuated by the distant shatter of glass. He exhaled once, slow and steady, and let his hand fall to the hilt at his side. The pommel was cool beneath his thumb, the twin-headed eagle of Ostravia catching the morning light.

With a single, fluid motion, he drew the blade. The steel flashed bright as lightning in the square. His horse shuddered beneath him, sensing the shift in the air, and Lukas drove his heels in while pulling hard at the reins. The mare reared, whinnying a challenge to the sky, and for a heartbeat all of Bellaqua seemed to draw a collective breath. Then came the roar. It was a storm of cheers and howls that surged up from the streets, a sound loud enough to shake the birds from the eaves.

And then the ground began to tremble.

The drums rolled through the air, deep and steady, the rhythmic heartbeat of an empire. The first ranks of the Ostravian infantry advanced, their boots slamming the earth so that it sounded like the mountain itself was walking. Rows upon rows of grey coats gleamed under the sun, brass buttons catching fire with every step. Their bayonets rose from their shoulders like a field of silver grass, swaying with the movement of the march. Behind the foot came the cavalry, thousands of massive, restless beasts with nostrils flaring white mist into the heat. Sunlight danced along the curved sabres and the dark barrels of carbines. The smell of gun oil and horse sweat began to thicken the air, drowning out the perfume and the sea-salt.

The crowd roared again, a deafening wave of sound that Lukas felt in his chest like a physical blow. He turned his horse slowly to face the pavilion, looking past the Duke and the shimmering nobles toward the foreign envoys huddled in their shaded boxes.

Lukas exhaled a long, measured breath and lifted his sword once more. The polished steel caught the glare of the noon sun, flashing like a beacon over the square.

Arms rose in response.

The motion rolled across the field in a silver wave. It was a forest of blades and bayonets, tens of thousands of points of light angled toward the pavilion. Toward her. Queen Alexandra had taken her seat beside the Duke without a single trumpet blast, yet the air in Bellaqua shifted the moment she appeared. She was a hollow-cheeked command in emerald silk, her hair a nest of pearls, her throat ringed by a diamond that burned with the ferocity of a fallen star. Beside her, the Duke’s red and white finery looked suddenly thin, like a child’s toy. Above them both, the great banner of the state rippled in the heat. The golden double-headed eagle on its blood-red field unfurled its wings, snapping in the wind as if it sought to take flight and hunt.

Lukas drove his spurs home. The mare surged, her hooves striking sparks from the pale cobblestones as he rode the narrow line between two worlds. To his right, the citizenry was a roaring, chaotic ocean of color and noise, leaning over the barriers and waving kerchiefs until the air was white with linen. To his left, the army was a wall of silent, grey iron.

Only one patch of color broke the perfect symmetry of the lines: the Caroleans.

They refused to wear the grey. They had always refused, and Lukas had long ago tired of the fight. Their coats were a deep, defiant blue, their hats trimmed in gold thread that glittered in the sun. Fewer than a thousand of them had deigned to attend the parade. August’s men were like their commander, brilliant, insubordinate, and forever standing just outside the line of order.

He reached the end of the line. There the world seemed to stop.

Three thousand men stood in rank upon rank, motionless beneath the burning sky. The ground itself seemed to tighten beneath their boots, the weight of them pressing into the very bones of the earth. Upon their backs rose the wings. They were great, sweeping plumes of eagle and swan feathers, catching the light until the entire host shimmered like a desert mirage. When the wind stirred, the wings whispered, a dry, predatory rustle like the sound of a thousand banners taking flight at once.

Their lances stood upright, seventeen feet of ashwood and tempered steel. They were a forest of violet and silver shafts, swaying in a slow, hypnotic unison that made the air glint with fractured reflections. Steel helmets hid their faces, leaving only the shadow of their intent. There was no mistaking the power in those broad shoulders and white gloves, gripping reins and wood with a quiet, lethal precision. The horses beneath them were monsters of muscle and bone, snorting clouds of steam into the salt air and stamping the earth in a rhythmic, impatient thunder.
