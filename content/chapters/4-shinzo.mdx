Daimyo Miyamoto of Ikezaki sat ensconced within the high chair at the head of a table of heavy, dark oak, a piece of furniture that Shinzo considered well-made for a provincial work. It was pretty yet functional, and the map’s corners slid softly into brass latches at the edges that clasped the parchment with a firm, gentle pressure to keep it flat against the wood.

The same, unfortunately, could not be said of the Daimyo himself, who was neither pretty to look upon nor in possession of a mind that held any particular alacrity of intellect. Shinzo had not harbored such a sharp dislike for the man when he was first dispatched as an attache from the towers of Shirogane, but the long, dragging month spent in the man’s company had done much to curd his opinion.

The morning sun streamed through the high windows, catching the silken wallpapers and sending light dancing about the room in a merry play, yet the brightness of the day seemed at odds with the cold knot in Shinzo’s gut. His eyes remained fixed upon the old man, on the wispy, ghost-white hair and the sagging cheeks that hung like melting wax, and those eyes that had recessed so deep into their sockets they were barely visible amidst the folds of aged flesh. The Daimyo held a parchment in his thick, liver-spotted fingers, his hands trembling with a rhythmic frailty.

Shinzo kept a smile pinned to his face.

He cast a cautious glance toward Tokugawa, who was smiling as if he were at a wedding feast, and toward Kashiro, who mirrored the expression with a practiced ease. 

The Daimyo unrolled the parchment with a slow, agonizing deliberation.

His voice began as a weak and feeble thing, like the whining of a mosquito in a man’s ear. “The Shogun Hikaru Toshinari, his excellency, blessed be his name,” he croaked, the words wet with a sort of pious devotion. “He has advised us to hold the fleets of the beggars here, at the throat of Ikezaki.” The Daimyo allowed a smile to break across his withered face, looking utterly pleased with himself, as if he had just won a great victory.. “A chance to show our valor,” he groaned, his chest swelling with a pride that seemed too heavy for his frail bones. “The Shogun, in his boundless wisdom, has entrusted us with this sacred charge. Six weeks shall pass as lightly as a summer’s breeze while Yamamoto sails with heaven’s wind at his back to deliver us from these barbarians.”

Shinzo’s mind drifted then, seeking escape in the sound of the wind-chimes singing their happy little song outside the casement, or in the thought of the flowers and the birds that knew nothing of the folly of men.

*So begins the pantomime*

“Your Majesty,” Kashiro spoke out.

He bowed deep, so deep that his forehead nearly brushed the oak, a lordling so dainty and refined that the word seemed the only one that fit. There was not a wrinkle to be found upon his polished skin, and though his frame was utterly unremarkable, there was something hard and cold lurking in his eyes. He was a man of average height, wearing spectacles that caught the sun, and his hair was bound in a long braid intertwined with ribbons of a blood-red hue.

“Speak your mind, Lord Kashiro,” the Daimyo replied. 

“I would have the room listen to your thoughts on the plan of defense, formulated with the aid of Tokugawa, to enable us to throw the Pact and hulls back into the dark of the sea.”, Kashiro said. 

The old man smiled broadly then, looking for all the world like a man who had just been told a ribald jest. 

Shinzo kept his gaze fixed upon the polished grain of the table, though his mind wandered to the weight of the service pistol at his hip. He had often considered the consequences of drawing the steel and putting an end to Miyamoto right there amidst the maps and the tea. On one hand, he would surely be tortured with a slow and meticulous cruelty that would make him long for the grave, but on the other, he would never again have to listen to the Daimyo speak. He would not have to endure these silken lordlings as they droned on about their grand stratagems and plans that smelled more of ink than of blood. If this were a market, he mused, it would be an attractive opportunity for a barter, his life for a moment of blessed silence.

Yet the duty held him fast. Shinzo knew he could not keep quiet at such a precipice, and so he inclined his body in a bow so deep it made his back ache.

“Your Majesty,” he intoned, his voice low and steady. He could not see them, but he felt the eyes of Tokugawa and Kashiro boring into the small of his back like hot needles. Those two would never listen to a man who had seen the muck of a trench, but perhaps there was a flicker of sense left in the Daimyo.

The old man merely furrowed his brow, the skin wrinkling like a dried plum, and offered a short, impatient nod. 

*Rude.*

“Doubtless, Your Majesty has understood the plan in the minutest of its details,” Shinzo said, the lie tasting like copper on his tongue. “Hence I believe that there is none so qualified as you to whom I might bring my humble thoughts.”

The odds were that the fattened pig had no damned clue of the maps before him, but the game had to be played. It would be a pity for it all to end this way, for the decades of his labor to be buried beneath the earth because of a squabble over pride and precedent. Well, mayhap the Redhand would carry the torch if he fell. Mayhap. The Daimyo did not deign to speak, relying instead on the strength of his bristling brows to grant Shinzo the leave to continue.

“I would not presume to question the wisdom of the plan, but I must recall Naguna, where the great guns stood idle and useless for want of powder while the enemy was at the gate,” Shinzo said, his voice sharpening with the memory of the slaughter. “Our roads are no wider now than they were then, and our wagons are no swifter. Our plan to crush the foe will surely not be injured by assigning some few of the peasants currently engaged in the redoubts to the task of widening the roads to the northern outposts. A gun that cannot be fed is naught but a heavy stone.”

Tokugawa interrupted then, his voice a sharp bark that cut through the stagnant air of the room. “Your point is noted, Colonel Shinzo. Let it be buried there.”

His eyes cracked open. 

It stung. 

*Should not have let the matter go.*

He had scarce slept an hour before the damned barrage was upon them once more, a relentless iron fist beating against the gates of Ido. For the entirety of the past day and much of this one, the black-hulled ships had pinned them inside the fortress like rats in a cellar. He snatched fitful snatches of slumber whenever the quiet allowed it, yet there was scarce much quiet to be had in this hell. The Pact fleet seemed to possess incessant stores of powder, for their fire continued in staggered, bone-shaking bursts even through the blackest hours of the night.

He heard a cough, sounding distant and muffled through the ringing in his ears. It was that sound again, the peculiar, guttural bark the Pact guns made when the ships loosed a volley. Broadsides were rare, for the bastards husbanded their strength, but once every few hours they would align a massive gunship and unleash its fire in one terrible, world-shaking roar.

His own powder barrels sounded hollow. A dozen rounds more for one gun, perhaps, and then they would be reduced to throwing stones. Kashiro’s grand plan would be the death of them all. The guns were hungry beasts, yet every cart from the interior came slower than the last, and every box arrived lighter than the one before. He glimpsed the iron hail in the sky, a dark rain of death, and his thoughts kept returning to those missing carts. It had been an age since the last supply had arrived at the gates. 

Something arced in the sky again, but this was not the dull grey of iron.

The iron struck the stone then with a sudden, deafening crescendo. The sound did not hurt him, for he was already half-deaf, but the stone beneath his boots shook as if the very earth were in its death throes. He felt the vibration ripple through his body and into his very teeth, which clattered and scratched against one another in his skull. Beside him, Akira collapsed onto the ground as a jagged shell fragment bit deep into his leg.

The ramparts were slick with a foul mixture of blood and grey dust, and the air reeked of salt and black powder and the smell of stone ground into grit by the cannon fire. All day the bodies had been taken from the walls of Ido, carried by the strong, dragged by the desperate, or simply left where they fell to stare at the sun with sightless eyes. Akira was half-crouched against the shattered parapet, one leg twisted beneath him like a broken branch. His face was the color of wood ash, yet when he looked up, his eyes remained glassy and defiant.

He tried to rise, pushing off the wall with a trembling hand, the other clamped tight over his thigh where the blood pulsed slow and dark through the torn cloth of his uniform. He managed to find his feet, swaying like a reed in a gale, the muscles in his arms quivering from the sheer, agonizing effort of it.

“Stay down!” Shinzo barked, his voice hoarse from the smoke, but Akira did not seem to hear him. He shifted his weight onto the good leg, straightening his back as if sheer, bloody will could drive the pain back into the silence of the bone.

Then the light came.

It was a sharp, sudden flash, green, not the warm orange of a cookfire nor the angry red of fresh blood, but a fierce, unnatural green that split the haze like a lightning bolt from an alien sky. It flared once, hanging high above the harbor for a heartbeat, and every man upon the wall turned his gaze toward it.

“Green?” Shinzo muttered, blinking against the lingering glare. His hands tightened upon the cold stone of the parapet until his knuckles were white. “What is that?”

No one answered. 

A messenger came flailing and tumbling through the soldiers currying around on the stone. 

There was a dark, wet bloom of blood at his waist that had turned his tunic into a sodden rag. He tried to stand straight, his wiry, lithe frame trembling with the gargantuan effort to draw a single breath, before his strength buckled and he collapsed onto one knee.

“Dragoons,” he coughed, and the word brought a spray of crimson that spattered the grey stone. He heaved once, his chest racking with a hollow sound, and then vomited a bitter slurry onto the parapet before collapsing further into the grit.

Shinzo gripped the man by the waist, half dragging and half carrying him until he could prop him against a shattered section of the wall. The man’s body was a ruined thing; the wound in his abdomen looked as if he had been licked by a heavy cavalry sabre, a deep and jagged cut that had opened his belly like an oilskin sliced for the last drop of water.

“Water!” Shinzo’s voice cracked through the din of the guns.

Someone thrust an oilskin into his hands without a word. He tore at the leather knot with his teeth and pressed the mouth of the flask to the man’s parched lips. The messenger drank greedily, his throat working in quick, desperate spasms as the water spilled down his chin and into the torn fabric of his coat. Then came the coughing. Deep and wet and terrible. The liquid turned red, then darker still, until what spilled from his mouth was more black than crimson, the color of old wine and rot. It streaked his neck and soaked through the grey powder on his chest, mixing with ash until there was no telling where the man ended and the battlefield began.

“No... time,” he managed to wheeze, each syllable dragging another thread of life out of him like a fisherman's hook. His fingers clawed weakly at Shinzo’s arm, a frantic, dying grip, before falling still once more.

“Enemy transports sighted!” someone shouted from the far end of the wall. The voice was loud but steady, cutting clean through the smoke and the confusion of the barrage and the chatter and the madness of the all. .

He swung toward the harbor, wiping the grime from his eyes with the back of his sleeve. Beyond the haze of the black-powder smoke, he could see the movement on the water, the faint, skeletal outlines of craft laden with troops, drifting like shadows among the great black gunships. Their oars flashed in the weak sun like the wings of insects hovering over a carcass.

Behind him, the messenger coughed again. His whole body seized with the effort, jerking like a puppet dancing on unseen hands. His eyes fluttered open wide, his pupils blown dark and cavernous.

“They have taken the road,” the boy groaned, and another bout of blood surged from his mouth to soak his dress. Some of the blood, hot and steaming in the morning air, soaked through Shinzo’s own breeches.

Shinzo started, his shoulder jerking of its own accord as a jolt of pure, cold terror ran through his frame. He opened his mouth to speak, but the words died in his throat like birds in a winter frost. He coughed, hacked, and cleared the soot from his lungs, spitting a dark glob onto the parapet as the truth settled into his bones. 

“Who has taken the road?” he screamed, the sound tearing from his throat like a jagged piece of iron.

“Kraken banners, mounted!” the response was blurted out once more, the words thick with the copper taste of death. The nurses gripped the messenger by his bloody shoulders, their hands stained to the wrists, but the light had already fled the boy’s eyes. They dropped him then, his head striking the stone with a dull, sickening thud that no one bothered to heed.

Shinzo’s gaze swept across the ruined parapet, finding Amara half-crouched by a broken embrasure, his eyes fixed on the roiling smoke below. He strode over, his boots slipping on the wet, crimson-streaked stone, and caught the young man by the collar of his tunic. “Find Okazaki,” he barked, his face mere inches from the boy’s. “Tell him to take his battalion and clear the road. “Kill them all!”

Amara blinked once, the confusion plain on his face, his mind likely still caught in the thunder of the sea-guns. “Now, fool!” Shinzo roared, his hand tightening before he shoved the boy backward with a force that sent him staggering. That did the work. Amara straightened at once, his back as stiff as a rod of cold iron. His salute came so sharply it was almost a farce, his palm smacking against his brow with a crack that echoed in the brief silence between salvos. “Yes!” he shouted, his voice breaking with the effort, and then he was gone, sliding down the muddy slope and disappearing into the chaos of the lower bailey.

Shinzo exhaled hard through his teeth, the air tasting of salt and soot. The wind shifted, carrying the stench of the charnel house, and he felt the thrum of the cannon fire still echoing in the very stone beneath his feet. He closed his eyes for a heartbeat, and the memory of that green flash burned behind his lids, a fierce and unnatural thing. Pact signaling, of course it was. A call to the black-hulled fleet, or perhaps a signal to the ghosts who had already found the shingle. The Pact had landed. 

The *how* of it mattered little now. What mattered was that mounted men were gnawing at his artery, and they had already set the saw to the bone. He pictured it as clearly as if he were watching from the heights: the heavy wagons stalled in the mire, the oxen shot in their yokes, and the precious powder kegs overturned and burning in the ditch. He saw a fresh salvo rise from the grey sea, a cluster of black specks against the clouds, but he ignored it. It would fall where it fell.

There would be no line of retreat if the road remained cut, no hope of a graceful exit from this theater of the damned. He had to open the road, and he prayed to whatever gods remained that Okazaki would not fail him. A new scent reached his nose then, rising above the brine. 

A loud, hollow bang echoed through the island, bouncing off the hills like the laughter of a giant. Smoke rose up inland, thick and greasy, climbing from a point near one of his hidden powder caches. The next explosion was farther still, drifting up from the direction of Ikezaki itself. 

He smirked then, a grim and lonely expression. A fine conundrum, truly. Miyamoto had spent many an hour prattling on about the indomitable spirit of the force, yet spirit did not count for much when there was no powder for the guns. He could stay and fight until the shells ground him into the grit, or he could retreat, save the men, and live out his days in a disgrace so deep it would drown his name.

If at all retreat was possible now.. 

It would hardly matter if some inbred numbskull at the court had allowed a Pact landing elsewhere; the calumny would befall him and him alone.
