Swen gritted his teeth as the iron salvo slammed into the ancient stone, the impact shuddering through the very marrow of his bones. His hands felt as if they were fused to the cold wood of his musket. He had spent thirty years upon the salt, a lifetime of tides and gales, yet when Horn loosed the *Mermaid* against the fortress it felt as if the Drowned God Himself had finally let His long-simmering rage be known to the world of men. It was a cruel thing to behold the gentle rays of the morning sun as if the heavens were entirely unaware of the carnage Man was unleashing beneath their gaze. The great guns ripped away chunks of the seaward stone like a babe might claw at a bowl of soft porridge, and the roar of the powder thrashed against Swen’s ears until the world was naught but a hollow, ringing void.

There was no point in screaming a command, for the wind and the iron would only swallow the words. There was no point in speaking at all.

He looked to his left, where Felix had raised the signal flags, the bright cloth snapping like a whip in the brine-heavy air. It was done, then. The troops, numbering a thousand souls, began their advance in a loose order. Swen splashed through the churning surf, feeling the freezing water climb up his woolose and seep into his innerclothes with a persistent, biting touch. It gnawed at him, that wetness, finding its way into every seam and fold of his being until he felt half-drowned while yet on his feet. He stepped onwards, his eyes flicking toward the hill on the right where the enemy guns were still belching smoke and flame against Horn’s ships.

Mostly, they held their fire for the hulls, but not entirely. He did not look back, for he was quite certain he had seen a plume of red swirling in the grey-green water behind him.

*Ah well.*

He stepped on, and the water began to recede, falling away to his ankles as the ground rose to meet him. He was nearly out of the quagmire now, the gentle approach to the hill laid bare before them. He blinked once, bracing his spirit as another salvo shrieked overhead and crashed into the stone with a sound like the world breaking in two. The salt spray entered his eyes, burning with a fierce, stinging heat, and he tried to blink it away with a curse. 

The earth in front of him suddenly erupted, throwing heavy clumps of muck into the air to rain down upon his shoulders like wet soot.

“Riflemen,” he heard someone grunt, the word followed by the sharp, whip-crack of a long-gun.

Beside him, another man collapsed into the surf without a sound, the water turning a bright, mocking red around the drifting corpse.

Forward, always forward.

It was a heady, staggering mix of terror and exhilaration that made his breath come in ragged gasps. He felt as if a strange, electric current were flowing through his very veins, like the numbing shock one felt when touching those pale eels in the hidden lagoons of the south. It was alien and terrible and wonderful all at once, as if standing on the edge of an abyss. 

Felix was farther ahead, the lighter man possessing the nimble grace of a mountain goat as he galloped over the slick terrain, planting a pinion a hundred yards in advance to mark their bloody progress.

Swen fell to the ground with a suddenness that made his very bones protest, his frame crashing into the soft, yielding earth with a force that rattled his teeth in their sockets. The shockwave of some unseen thunder passed through his body, leaving a ringing in his ears far worse than any church bell.. A keening sound, like the high wail of a banshee screamed in his head until his organs refused to acknowledge any other noise in the world. Hot blood rushed to the face. The veins in his forehead throbbed. It felt as if someone were trapped inside his skull. Trying to hammer their way out through the bone. He grunted as the wet mud entered his mouth, tasting acrid and bitter.

He did not feel any pain.  That silence of the flesh that worried him. The heart was racing at a million leagues an hour against his ribs. He dared not look down at his own body, dared not examine the limbs that were splayed out upon the muck like discarded firewood.

*Small mercies.*

He turned his body, the effort of the movement proving unexpectedly easier than he had dared to hope, and he found that his ribs seemed to be whole. Swung his head to the left and then to the right, peering through the smoke and the spray, and then he looked up and down. He tried to offer a prayer to the Drowned One. He prepared himself then, steeling his heart to see a fountain of crimson flowing from his breast like oil from a leaking skin.

Nothing. 

He swung his gaze skywards and for a moment the world seemed to slow its frantic pace.

Iron hung in the air, a great, jagged ghost of metal.

It was a cannon, or what remained of one, flying through the grey clouds like a bird of ill omen. Not shot, but the fragments of what had once been a shore gun. Its barrel had ripped apart in a fit of metallic rage, exploding with a roar louder than anything Swen had ever heard in his thirty years at sea, sending red-hot iron arcing up and over the field in a rain of fire.

The cries rose up then, thin and shrill between the rhythmic shrieks of the fleet’s artillery. From the crest of the hill, more explosions sounded out in a rapid, staccato succession that shook the very ground. 

*Powder magazines.*

Swen hauled in a lungful of air that tasted of sulfur and salt. The breath made him cough until his lungs burned, and he felt a heavy arm upon his shoulder, pulling him up from the mire. He could not see who it was through the haze of the black powder, but he managed to find his strength and place a trembling knee under his body.

“Do not stop,” he said, though he knew not if the command was for his men or for the very blood in his veins. He could not hear the words leave his lips; it was as if the world had been plunged into a deep, silent pool.

The slope up to Miyumi fanned wide before them, the acrid smoke thinning just enough to reveal the movement of men reforming and flames dancing on the hill. Here the incline was gentler, and the mud, though still a grasping, hungry thing that pulled at a man's boots with every step, was less deep than the mire of the beach. Swen drew in a jagged breath  screamed with every ounce of his soul.

“Lines!”

No sound reached his ears, only the rhythmic, heavy pounding of his own pulse and the hammering inside his skull that refused to cease. He could feel his throat tearing with the force of the shout, could see the shape of the command leaving his mouth, yet the world remained as silent as a grave. Felix, however, caught the command.

Then he turned, raising the signal flag high above the swirling haze of the battle. The red cloth unfurled against the grey sky. The chaos seemed to still.

The enemy riflery had grown weak.. He took his place at the right end of the second line, watching as his men formed themselves into three neat lines. Their black coats were soaking wet, heavy with the weight of the sea, yet as he looked upon those ranks,  his heart swelled with a fierce, cold pride.

The drums began.

The fort upon the hill looked a much smaller thing now that they were clawing toward its throat. It was not even a proper fortress of stone and high towers, but a squat, ugly thing of earth and timber. As Swen marched upwards, his gaze fixed on the ramparts, he saw that the walls could not be more than six feet in height. 

Three hundred yards.

The first of the skirmishers, the rugrats, as the men called them, were already ranging ahead of the lines, engaging the enemy in a scattered, stinging fire. The drums went on, their steady beat growing louder than the scattered gunfire now.  He could see the fort clearly now, see the dark snouts of the few remaining guns and the glint of musket barrels poking out over the low walls like the quills of a porcupine.

Two hundred yards.

They marched on, and the silence in Swen's ears felt like the holding of a great breath before the scream.

The enemy fire came too soon and fell too short, a desperate waste of lead that hissed into the mud a hundred yards distant. At the sharp signal, the first rank collapsed prone into the muck to clear the field of fire, and Swen felt his own knees strike the soft earth as the second rank knelt beside them.

“Fire!”

The three ranks loosed their souls at once. Swen felt the sweet, brutal kick of the musket against his shoulder as a thousand barrels unleashed their thunder in a single volley. A wall of acrid white smoke surged forward, blotting out the world and stinging the eyes, while the collective crack of the musketry finished the ruin of Swen’s hearing.

“Gott mit uns!” Swen roared into the void. He could see the veins standing out in the necks of the men around him, their mouths agape in a silent scream of defiance, yet not a whisper of their shouting reached his ears. It was a phantom war, a dance of shadows and light. 

He drew his steel and fixed the bayonet with a click that he felt in his bones r. Through the shifting haze, the low wall of the fort seemed to dissolve into a cloud of grey, and then the world folded in on itself as the black coats surged forward like a rising tide.

The butchery was brief. 

Once the Pactmen had crested the parapet, the heart went out of the defenders; most broke and fled with barely a shot fired, their boots splashing frantically in the retreat. 

One final, ragged volley followed them into the trees, and then the work was done.

The prisoners were huddled on their knees, a crooked and miserable line of mud-streaked figures bowed before the drifting smoke. Some trembled, while one man retched into the dirt until there was nothing left within him but gall. 

Milo found him then, his grin a slash of white bone against a face masked in soot and salt. "That was easier than we thought," the scout said. He was a small, lithe creature built for the deep woods, with lean legs and quick hands that could navigate a mile of brambles while another man was still searching for the path. His clothes were a ruin of a dozen tears, and the edge of his knife was still wet with a dark, glistening fluid.

"Easier," Swen echoed.

Hearing was returning in fitful surges, yet Milo’s voice still seemed to drift from the far end of a long tunnel. The screaming of the living had largely died away, replaced by the thin moans of the dying.

He had been correct in his reckoning; the barrels of the remaining enemy guns were red-hot to the touch, shimmering in the damp air. It was small wonder the shore batteries had turned into iron traps. Swen sank to one knee, his joints groaning. Near his boot lay a fragment of bone, the flesh burned clean away by some white-hot blast, and all around him the bodies were mangled into shapes no longer human, stinking and steaming worse than any offal pit in the capital.

He moved closer to one of the surviving pieces,. To a casual eye it looked whole, yet as Swen peered closer he saw the barrel had begun to curve and droop rendering  its aim worthless. Beside it sat its brother, a gun whose barrel had bloomed open like a black flower, the very hearth of the explosion that had likely sent the powder barrels into the sky. 

It was a strange and telling sight. A few hours of feverish fire and these guns were failing to the heat in a way no Pact-forged steel would ever dream of doing. Swen reached into his pocket and withdrew a small, battered diary and a stump of pencil. 

"That is why I tell you to store your powder with the care of a midwife," Swen said to Milo, who was surveying the ruin.

Milo walked back to him. "Our own guns will be brought onto the shingle within the hour," he snapped, the words coming quick before he loped off with his squad to vanish into the scrub inland.

There was no time to linger amidst the cooling iron and the cooling dead. The guns were hauled through the surf by cursing men. The wounded were sent back to the swaying mercy of Horn’s fleet, and a few salt-cracked sailors were pressed into the ranks to fill the gaps where the steel had bitten deepest. They were away within two hours, the march turning fierce and unrelenting as they struck inland. The officers and the scouts were mounted now upon looted horses, the beasts shaggy and wild-eyed, yet they served well enough for the work at hand.

They marched through the long, humid day and snatched a few hours of fitful sleep only when the moon rose high enough to cast its pale, ghostly light across the path. Even as the infantry lay in the dirt, the scouts worked in shifts, prowling the dark like wolves to loot and steal whatever mules or nags they could find in the scrub. On that first night after the blood-work at Miyumi, the rugrats found a village and wrested a great herd of horses from the frightened locals, enough to change the pace of their war.

When the heavy hand of a sentry woke him, Swen called for Nistel and Felix to attend him. The air was thick with the scent of wet pine and old sweat.

“Nistel, take three hundred men and strike north for Ido immediately,” Swen commanded in rasp that brooked no argument. “Use the new mounts. Speed is your only shield now.”

He turned then to Felix, whose face was half-hidden in the shadows of his cowl. “That will leave us with thirty more animals. Felix, you are to set up a courier relay between my main force and Nistel. I will not have us stumbling into the dark without a word from one another.”

Felix offered a short, sharp nod of agreement, but Nistel’s brow furrowed in the moonlight. “We could use thirty more men for the mounted strike, Swen. Three hundred is a thin wedge.”

The other officer merely shook his head, his gaze fixed on the dark line of the trees. “The road is a nasty piece of work, and the woods have ears. We cannot allow ourselves to be cut off, or we are all of us dead men walking. Better thirty riders to carry the word than thirty morein a trap.”

Nistel set off nearly at once, the muffled hoofbeats of his troop fading into the night, and Swen collapsed back into his cloak to chase a few more hours of oblivion. The march began again before the first light had even begun to grey the sky.  None of them had washed and their salt encrusted clothes had become a grating presence. Every step scratched at the skin. And the wet air stuck the clothes to the skin in all their salty and dirt-filled malevolence. 

The rugrats reported nothing of a Shogunate response as yet, a silence that Swen hoped was owed to Gunther and Erik hammering away at the other coastal points. It was a fine thing, so long as the enemy remained distracted.. The moment they struck Ido from the rear, the defense of the island would be unhinged, like a door with its pins knocked out.

By the night of the next camp, they found an abandoned village where no cooking smoke rose to meet the stars. The troops grumbled and cursed into their collars. Giving away the location of the host for the sake of a hot bowl of pottage would give Erik enough jesting ammunition to last him three campaigns, and Swen had no desire to be the butt of a camp song. The peasants had some strange, animal sense of danger, Swen mused as he walked the silent street; they had vanished like ghosts, leaving only empty huts and the smell of woodsmoke.

Inside Swen's quarters, the map was spread out upon the floor, a dirty, stained thing that had been scrawled over so many times the parchment was nearly worn through. Milo ducked inside, his lithe frame caked in mud and smelling of damp earth and crushed ferns, looking very much like a man who had been wrestling with the forest itself. Without a word, the scout knelt upon the ground and set to work, his quick fingers marking out the positions with a piece of charcoal. Fifty men still held the ruin of Miyumi. Squads of scouts were scrawled in, their expected locations little more than guesses in the dark. 

“What does Nistel report?” Milo asked.

Felix let out a weary breath that seemed to rattle in his chest. “Erik is hammering at Ido with everything the fleet can spit. Nistel is busy burning the supply routes to the ground, or so the last rider claimed.” Felix reached out with a piece of charcoal, his fingers stained black as a coal-miner's, and marked a jagged point upon the road. “This was the last reported location of Nistel’s force. He has already traded steel with some Shogunate units, likely the vanguard of their relief.”

Swen offered a curt nod. “I wonder if Erik will have enough time to put his boots on the shingle before the hornet's nest is truly stirred. It seems sending Nistel’s company off on those looted nags was a gamble that has paid its weight in silver, for now at least.”

“Felix, did Nistel find anything in the north to requisition?” Swen asked, his eyes still locked upon the parchment.

The officer  paused for a heartbeat. “He has seized a few Shogunate stores, though whether they hold rice or rock is anyone’s guess. He is already engaged at Ido, in any event. Eldholt can resupply him from the hulls if the need grows dire enough.”

“We are on the edge of our rations. This needs to end quick.” The commander said. 

The rugrat pointed at a scrawl on the map. “At least four thousand of them. They are a three-hour march from where we stand and perhaps two or three days from Ido, going by the sluggish pace of their marching,” Milo said, and he allowed himself that good, old lopsided smile of his. “They are marching out of Ikezaki, we believe, and their hearts are set on Ido. Unless Erik can summon the Drowned God, he will not seize that fortress against such a tide as that.”

Swen laughed and threw his head back to take a savage bite of his hardtack. The others fell into a heavy silence for a moment, and in that quiet, Swen could hear a steady, rhythmic thumping in the far distance. Even the windows of the hovel seemed to shudder now and again, rattled by the ghost of a thunder that refused to cease. It was the artillery, a great and terrible duel at Ikezaki. The fortress was half a day’s march from their position, yet the cannonades were audible even here.

“Gunther has certainly pinned down a great host,” Milo continued. “He thinks there is an entire division’s worth of troops there, and the word is that the fighting around Ikezaki has turned fierce and bloody already.”

“Nistel has three hundred men,” Felix intoned.

“And we have five hundred here,” Swen mused, tapping his fingers against the hilt of his sword. “Though I harbor no great worry for Gunther. He is pouring enough iron into Ikezaki to wake the Seven Sleepers themselves.”

Milo shrugged, his lean shoulders moving beneath his torn coat. “This force, I have taken to calling them the Force Mistral. They do not know of our presence yet, for the scouts have done their work well, but I do not know if that grace will hold for long. A host of four thousand has many eyes.”

Swen looked down at the map again. 

*A creative name*. 

This little village sat upon a small hill, a slight incline that offered a vantage point over the rolling country below.

“Change in plans,” he spoke at last. “Leave Nistel to harass the road of Ido. As long as he can burn enough of their powder to keep them busy, it will have to do for our purposes. We cannot allow this Mistral to reach Erik, or the campaign is lost. We will have to engage them here.”

Felix smirked. “Eight on one, Swen. Those are the kind of odds that make for very short songs.”

Swen grinned back. “We only need to hold until Ido falls. Send a message north. Tell Nistel of this Mistral and that we intend to bite at their heels. Tell them they must keep their eyes peeled for a northward strike by the Shogun’s troops. We are in the lion’s mouth now, and we had best keep our wits about us.”

“Milo, harass Mistral, bait them into engaging us. Strike when it's dark.”



“Adjourned,” the commander announced, and the room emptied as quickly as a punctured wineskin. He reached into the depths of his pocket and withdrew a single, loose cigar, the last of his store, holding it in his left hand while he raised his right before his eyes. It was shaking, a faint and persistent tremor that spoke of the blood's heat and the soul's cold. He wondered if Felix or Milo felt that same tingle, that sharp, electric thrill of the gamble that comes when a man stakes his life on a single turn of the deck. He retrieved his lighter, the flame flickering briefly in the gloom, and took a deep drag, letting the grey smoke curl slowly from his lips like a ghost.

He collapsed onto the hard-packed earth of the floor. In the dust beside him lay a small wooden horse set upon tiny wheels, a child’s plaything. The craftsmanship was not the work of a master, yet it was pretty enough in its simple way, and the wood was worn smooth by the touch of small hands. These people had fled in a desperate hurry, he mused, abandoning the treasures of the nursery to the boots of marching men.

The Mistral would know of their presence in a few hours if fortune favored the bold, yet Swen found a measure of relief in the sight beyond the door. 

His men were good at this.
